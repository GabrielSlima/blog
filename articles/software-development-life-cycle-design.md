        Recently I've decided to explore a bit more about each stage
        from the SDLC (Software Development Life-Cycle). This process
        is actually part of the job, it's part of the daily basis
        of a software developer/software engineer and it's easier than
        you think to forget that there are different approaches to
        execute it.

        The last articles I've been learning and writing about it
        in order to become more familiar with all the stages and
        explore the activities of each one of them. The main goal
        is to master the basics (maybe I'll write an article about
        this too).

        Welcome to the piewdiepie's favourite blog about Software Engineering
        and today's topic is <strong>Software Development Life-Cycle: Exploring the Design Stage</strong>.
        Let's get started.
    </p>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
        If you are familiar with the SDLC, you already know that every new software, piece of software
        or any alteration to an existing one goes through a development process composed
        by at least 5 stages: analysis, <strong>design</strong>, implementation,
        testing and deploy. That's kind of the natural process every new code or alteration
        goes through till it's available for the final user.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you read the last two articles in which I talk more about the <a href="#" target="blank">Analysis Stage</a>
        and <a href="#" target="blank">Techniques for the Analysis Stage</a> or already
        is familiar with the analysis stage, you know that this stage, the analysis stage
        can also be called <strong>requirements analysis and initial desing</strong>. That's because
        it's intented to create a inital model of the software/system. This means that what the software
        must have, must do and how it must look like is documented by the business/system analyst.
    </p>
    <p>
        The output of the analysis stage are documents describing the software
        without implementation constraints. These documents are
        input for the design stage, guiding the designer on creating an specification of the
        system to be created.
    </p>
    <h3>The System Specification</h3>
    <p>
        The <i>system/software specification</i> is composed by some types of documents
        that are actually some type of desing: interface design, basic architecture design,
        database design and programs design. The system specification will be
        used at the implmentation phase by the developers, it's a plan of what
        needs to be done.
    </p>
    <h4>Basic Architecture Design</h4>
    <p>
        The basic architecture design will describe what the system has,
        what hardware, software and infraestructure will be used.
        Most of the time, existing hardware, software and infraestructure
        are altered instead of new ones being created.
    </p>
    <h4>Interface Design</h4>
    <p>
        The interface is the <i>user interface</i>, if applicable,
        representations of how the system/software will look like
        is created. This means that if the software has a website,
        the screens are actually prototyped.
    </p>
    <h4>Database Design or File Design</h4>
    <p>
        Definition of what data will be manipulated and where it will be
        stored.
    </p>
    <h4>Programs Design</h4>
    <p>
        Every program identified at the basic architecture stage
        must be defined. This means that every program that
        need to be written will have a specific description
        of what it will do.
    </p>
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
        Solutions can be made only when we understand the problem.
    </p>
    Good Luck XD
