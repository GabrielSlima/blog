        Recently I've decided to explore a bit more about each stage
        from the SDLC (Software Development Life-Cycle). This process
        is actually part of the job, it's part of the daily basis
        of a software developer/software engineer and it's easier than
        you think to forget that there are different approaches to
        execute it.

        The last articles I've been learning and writing about it
        in order to become more familiar with all the stages and
        explore the activities of each one of them. The main goal
        is to master the basics (maybe I'll write an article about
        this too).

        Welcome to the piewdiepie's favourite blog about Software Engineering
        and today's topic is <strong>Software Development Life-Cycle: Exploring the Design Stage</strong>.
        Let's get started.
    </p>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
        If you are familiar with the SDLC, you already know that every new software, piece of software
        or any alteration to an existing one goes through a development process composed
        by at least 5 stages: analysis, <strong>design</strong>, implementation,
        testing and deploy. That's kind of the natural process every new code or alteration
        goes through till it's available for the final user.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you read the last two articles in which I talk more about the <a href="#" target="blank">Analysis Stage</a>
        and <a href="#" target="blank">Techniques for the Analysis Stage</a> or already
        is familiar with the analysis stage, you know that this stage, the analysis stage
        can also be called <strong>requirements analysis and initial desing</strong>. That's because
        it's intented to create a inital model of the software/system. This means that what the software
        must have, must do and how it must look like is documented by the business/system analyst.
    </p>
    <p>
        The output of the analysis stage are documents describing the software and it will be
        the input for the design stage, guiding the designer on creating the representation of the
        system.
    </p>
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <h3>Infrastructure Specificiation</h3>
    <h3>Program specification</h3>
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
        The analysis stage can be hard. It may require lots of interviews and
        effort to have concise and clear requirements. The result are long documents that may contain diagrams like
        use cases, UML and flowcharts. These documents
        will be the input for the design stage, they are
        also called <i>initial desing</i> of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I said, the main goal is to create a model of the system that
        is indepedent of implementation constraints. The solution 
        considering environment and language constraints is accomplished
        at the design phase.

    Good Luck XD
