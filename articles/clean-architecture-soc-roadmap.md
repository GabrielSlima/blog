        Hey, welcome back to the PewdiePie's favourite blog
        about Software Engineering and today I would like
        to share with you my rodamp for separating the system's
        architecture into different concerns. Let's
        get into it!

    <h3>The 4 main concerns your architecture should support</h3>
    Good Luck XD
