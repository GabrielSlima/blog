        I don't have many years of experience in Software Engineering, during these last months
        i started to ask myself if documentation is realy a thing and if it's worth it
        to spend time bulding them.

        Welcome to the Pewdiepie's favourite blog that maybe is only about Software Engineering
        and today I would like to share with you my thoughts about documentation and what I'm
        considering to do about it to save myself from the pain of having to understand
        complex desings... 
    </p>
    <h3>Is documentation realy important?</h3>
    <p>
        Since I started to acquire more knowledge about and work with Software Engineering,
        documentation always seemed a problem or the solution to all problems related to
        the knowledge about the project itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working on a complex code base with lots of classes and lines of code is hard.
        For a period of time I thought that having a documentation that shows how the system
        is organized, what it was supposed to do and how it's doing was going to make things
        easier for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, working with a product where the overall objective is to reduce the amount
        of manual work of the users it seems that documentation is irrelevant at a certain
        degree. Writing what the system was supposed to do seems a waste of time because
        what it was supposed to do may be different next week...
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm reading this book about OOP and the author always talks about the use of UML,
        requirements and on later chapters he focuses on introducing a development process.
        The phases can be summyrized into 3 steps, requirements, desing and implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Documentation is a tricky subject because it gives you the impression that it's
        the answer. For instance, I worked on a product where some of the features
        was something that <i>could be useful for the user</i>. At that time I had to fix
        and, after strugling to understand the code, add some new things to an existing feature.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hard part was that no one seemed to
        know precisely what the feature was supposed to do. Some of them knew what
        the feature was about but nobody could tell what output it should produce.
        A documentation about what the feature was supposed to do, what it was supposed
        to produce and where all the used data was coming from seemed the solution
        for my problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's greate to have a starting point when designing a OOP system. A plan of what
        I have to create within the application seems a good idea. Or at least was.
