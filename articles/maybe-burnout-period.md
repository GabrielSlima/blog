    <p>I think i've experienced burnout... My last article was almost 2 years ago and what shocks me the most is that it doesn't feel that much time has passed, to be honest. Today, I was planning to write
    an article related to microservices - maybe something related to circuit breakers and how to implement them in Python.
    <br>
    Things took a different path...
    </p>
    <h3> The signs</h3>
    <p>I don't remember specifically what happend every month after Augst 2022, but I know there were
    persistent signs and common behaviors and thoughts that went through my head everyda since.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>push forward</h4>
    <p>This was for sure the number one thought during my days. Despite always feeling tired, not thinking straight, and not having a clear idea of what I was doing or why, just going through what i thought was a plan, just pushing forward was the number one priority for over a year.
    <br>
    In my head discipline would bring me success; it was the only thing that would matter at the end of the day. Suddenly, I was doing a lot things, but didn't quite know the motive. I don't think just stopping doing things is the answer-I just didn't have the right mindset for that. I thought that working toward my goals only counted if i was executing the tasks i set for that goal specifically. Checkpoints and timeboxes to revaluate my goal and check if I was on the right track were not exactly working to achieve the goal itself. I figured it was just lack of time and that all my energy should be focused on doing goal-oriented tasks. This led me to procrastination, and eventually, i just stopped doing whatever i was doing.
    </p>
    <p> If i were to go back and do something different it would be quite a few things. First of all, set timeboxes throughout the month and year to check your progress. This time will be dedicated to revaluating and reprioritizing your plans. Don't just go executing a half plan. Have a complete doable plan for your goal. Only start acting when you know what you have to do.
    <br>
    Another very important thing is to <b>have a deadline</b> for EVERYTHING. Don't ever leave something behind. Nerver leave a single task without a specific timebox set, even if it takes more than what you've planned. Not doing this led me to procrastination again.
    </p>
    <p>Don't forget to change the way you think regarding timeboxes to plan and prioritize stuff: planning what you will do and adding checkpoints is also work and it's the smart move. If you keep navigating without a compass or, worse, without a well-defined goal, eventually you will get there - you just don't know where or when and will have to hope that your clean water lasts until you get there.<p>
    <h4>Lost Track of Time</h4>
    <p>A side effect of just doing stuff for the sake of doing is losing track of time. We lose track of time doing stuff we like; in my case, i lost track of time because i was living one day after the other without a clear plan and not having checkpoints. I spent months looking for the answer to "how much design up front should I do" and im still not sure about the answer</p>
    <h4>Feeling of going in circles in my study plan and strong impostor syndrome</h4>
    <p>I'll tell you what I had... I had the brilliant idea of reading books and blog about them. I have a list of 100+ books i want to go through-technical books, books about software engineering, and computer science. But my mental state pushed me into not setting specific goals for my weeks and months. I ended up with a goal of reading 10 pages every day. Eventually, reading 10 pages of a book about code became unsustainable and I ended up reading 7 pages a day, then 5, then nothing at all. 
    <br>
    This caused me to always go back to the same books,looking for the same topics with the same questions
    and never leaving this state. I started to doubt every decision I made about everything. I was never certain about anything. This brought me huge impostor syndrome and a lack of confidence in absolutely everything I did.
    </p>
    <h4>Lost track of my career and thought about quiting my job</h4>
    <p>I lost count of how many times I considered quiting my job. Maybe being the tech lead didn't help.
    The feeling that my team members were judging every answer, every word I said, and every decision I made
    was driving me crazy. The fear of not having the answers along with not very well-stablished plans and just working like crazy to fall into the same errors over and over again, made my impostor syndrome worse. At some point, I was just feeling completely alone, responsible for having all the answers and make everything work.
    </p>
    <h3>Recovery and regaining my confidence</h3>
    <h4>Looking for guidance from more senior professionals</h4>
    <p>You're not the first person to feel lost in your career. You're not the first person to feel impostor syndrome in the world or in your company. One thing i did was to reach out to my leadership, coworkers that I trust and are in a similar position to mine, tech leads and specialists in software engineering, and solution architects and looking for guidance.
    </p>
    <h4>Plan everything, even fun time, and specially with enough spaces in between the timeboxes</h4>
    <p>It's tempting to just put on your shoes and start running. But believe me, it's the last thing you want to do. Plan every month of the year, and plan every year by connecting to things you want to achieve next year. Plan every week of every month. Use agile principles in your favor to prevent over-planning, but don't start executing wihout a plan.
    <br>
    Also, don't forget to schedule timeboxes to do nothing or do watever you want. For instance, go outside just say hi to strangers. This will help you to deviate your  focus a little bit and give time for your thoughts to rearrange in your head. When you get back to your stuff, you will have that mental clarity.
    </p>
    <h4>If you started,finish, but if it's going to take too long, do the minimum and do what is easy</h4>
    <p>One thing that got me stuck in the same place for weeks was my principle of finishing what i've started. But i ended up spending weeks and months trying to finish what doesn't make any sense. So i started to apply the same idea of "skim-reading"-which is reading something quickly, to everything I was having trouble finishing. Have to clean up the house but keep procrastinating? Wherever you go, do something easy. Not easy to clean up the flor? Just collect the big stuff around. Just do it and do it fast.</p>
    <h4>Productivity is doing less, not more</h4>
    <p>At some point, I had all 24 hours of my day filled with something to do. Let me tell you something: It does not work like that. Some things will take more time than expected, especially if you are doing it outside. In the gym for instance. Just stop, ok? Plan less stuff in your days and respect your energy levels. Productivity is about doing less with quality and focus. Prioritize rest and recovery, always.<p>
