        If you read <a href="#">this article</a> where I talk about
        the software development life-cycle you know that every
        software or piece of software, being an alteration or a new
        piece within the entire systems has a life-cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main purpose of breaking the software development
        process into different phases is to have smaller and manageable
        phases. Sometimes, those phases can be accomplished in parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first phase every softeare or piece of software goes
        through is the analysis. In short, the analysis phase
        is where the problems are identified and documented so that
        later a solution can be created based on it. Today I'll
        try to give you more details about this phase.
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to the piewdiepie's favourite blog about Software Engineering
        and today's topic is <strong>Software Development Life-Cycle: Analysis</strong>.
        Let's get started.
    </p>
    <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
    <p>
        Every organization is supported in some way by people or even
        other oganizations. Without them, the organization wouldn't
        exist. These groups are also called <i>Stakeholders</i>.
        An Stakeholder is a member of those groups. It can be an entire
        group or a single person.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each group, I mean, each stakeholder has a concern.
        The Government for instance is concerned about taxation, employment,
        legislation and so on.
        <br>
        The customers are concerned about value and quality. The employees
        are aconcerned about respect, compensation, appreciation,
        time off, recognition and so on. Investors are concerned about income.
    </p>
    <p>
        An organizaiton can have quite a few stakeholders. These are
        just some examples that you might have heard of. Every organization is
        supported by stakeholders, without them, the organization probably wouldn't exist.
    </p>
    <h3>The analysis stage</h3>
    <p>
        At this stage main goal is to actually know the problems
        so we know what must be created to solve them.
        Every activity at this stage is intented to identify and document
        problems and business processes to create models that are
        independent of implementation rules. Independent of
        infrastrucutre and language constraints and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        This stage is composed by 3 basic activities. Each of them
        addresses a different concern. Here is a very summarized description:
    </p>
    <h4>Requirements Gathering or Requirements Discovery</h4>
    <p>
        Before actually creating any solution, we need to know
        what is required from the software. At this step
        wet get to know more about business processes. It
        also may include interviews with stakeholders to know
        how they relate with each other so that the business process is
        accomplished.
    </p>
    <h4>Requirements Documentation or Requirements Recording</h4>
    <p>
        The requirements must be documented. I mean, the business
        processes and details about the relationship between the
        stakeholders must be documented/recorded.
        <br>
        This information may be documented in many forms including
        requirements list, natural language documentation, use cases,
        user stories, data models and any other ways of models of
        process documentation.
        <br>
        Another very common way of documenting the requirements is
        through prototypes.
    </p>
    <h4>Requirements Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        All the documented requirements is analysed. Baiscally what
        the software must have and how it must function is avaliated.
        The main goal here is to have a concise, undiplicated, complete,
        clear requirements and if they actually makes sense.
    </p>
    <h3>Requirement types</h3>
    <p>
        In short, there are two types of requirements a system may have.
        Functional and non-function.
    </p>
    <h4>Functional requirements</h4>
    <p>
        Functional requirements or behavior requirements are specific
        services a system must provide. I other words,
        are specific behaviors the system should have.
        <br>
        They are specified by the user and are usually documented
        using use cases. If you don't know what a use case is,
        it's basically a diagram that represents how a specific behavior
        should happend in the system. It also shows how users interact
        with this behavior or how other systems or parts of the system
        interact with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        A quick example of these types of requirements is a login page.
        Once logged, the user can only see the pages he/her has permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another example would be a cart from an ecommerce web site.
        The client must be able to have a cart without having being registered
        to the platform. Along with this requirement, others can appear like
        the user must be able to see all products of the created cart, along
        with the total amount he has to pay.
    </p>
    <h4>Non-functional requirements</h4>
    <p>
        Non-functional requirements or non-behavior requirements,
        are quality requirements the system <strong>may have</strong>.
        In other words, these requirements are directly related to the
        quality of the system as a whole and doesn't have a direct connection
        with the behaviors required for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        These requirements that guarantee the quality of the system
        can address issues like: security, performance, reliability,
        flexibility, mantainability, portability, scalability and reusability.
        <br>
        They are also specified by technical people, like architects, tech lead
        or software developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Examples of this kind of requirements would be:
        The website should be able to have 1000 users simultaneously without
        crashing or without slowing down more than 3s for each page.
        <br>
        Each request must not take more than 15s. If we are talking about perfomance.
        <br>
        Another example would be: User's should not be able to manage
        it's own scopes. Or if they can, they must go through an approval process
        before having the scope into it's profile. If we are talking about
        security.
    </p>
    <p>
        The result of the requirements analysis are documents. They include the
        the problem or problems and solutions for those problems.
    </p>
    Good Luck XD
