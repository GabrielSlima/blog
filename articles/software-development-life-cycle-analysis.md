        If you read <a href="#">this article</a> where I talk about
        the software development life-cycle you know that every
        software or piece of software, being an alteration or a new
        piece within the entire systems has a life-cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main purpose of breaking the software development
        process into different phases is to have smaller and manageable
        phases. Sometimes, those phases can be accomplished in parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first phase every softeare or piece of software goes
        through is the analysis. In short, the analysis phase
        is where the problems are identified and documented so that
        later a solution can be created based on it. Today I'll
        try to give you more details about this phase.

        Welcome to the piewdiepie's favourite blog about Software Engineering
        and today's topic is <strong>Software Development Life-Cycle: Analysis</strong>.
        Let's get started.
    </p>
    <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
    <p>
        Every organization is supported in some way by people or even
        other oganizations. Without them, the organization wouldn't
        exist. These groups are also called <i>Stakeholders</i>.
        An Stakeholder is a member of those groups. It can be an entire
        group or a single person.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each group, I mean, each stakeholder has a concern.
        The Government for instance is concerned about taxation, employment,
        legislation and so on.
        <br>
        The customers are concerned about value and quality. The employees
        are aconcerned about respect, compensation, appreciation,
        time off, recognition and so on. Investors are concerned about income.
    </p>
    <p>
        An organizaiton can have quite a few stakeholders. These are
        just some examples that you might have heard of. Every organization is
        supported by stakeholders, without them, the organization probably wouldn't exist.
    </p>
    <h3>The analysis stage</h3>
    <p>
        At this stage main goal is to actually know the problems
        so we know what must be created to solve them.
        Every activity at this stage is intented to identify and document
        problems and business processes to create models that are
        independent of implementation rules. Independent of
        infrastrucutre and language constraints and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        This stage is composed by 3 basic activities. Each of them
        addresses a different concern. Here is a very summarized description:
    </p>
    <h4>Requirements Gathering or Requirements Discovery</h4>
    <p>
        Before actually creating any solution, we need to know
        what is required from the software. At this step
        wet get to know more about business processes. It
        also may include interviews with stakeholders to know
        how they relate with each other so that the business process is
        accomplished.
    </p>
    <h4>Requirements Documentation or Requirements Recording</h4>
    <p>
        The requirements must be documented. I mean, the business
        processes and details about the relationship between the
        stakeholders must be documented/recorded.
        <br>
        This information may be documented in many forms including
        requirements list, natural language documentation, use cases,
        user stories, data models and any other ways of models of
        process documentation.
        <br>
        Another very common way of documenting the requirements is
        through prototypes.
    </p>
    <h4>Requirements Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        All the documented requirements is analysed. Baiscally what
        the software must have and how it must function is avaliated.
        The main goal here is to have a concise, undiplicated, complete,
        clear requirements and if they actually makes sense.
    </p>
    Good Luck XD
