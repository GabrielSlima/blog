        A couple of years ago I discovered that didn't know how
        to learn things, including programming and english. If you don't know,
        english is not my native language. Of course this is an evolutive process.
        There are many stuff that we must learn using different approaches.
        But many things can be learned by using basically the same
        technique.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't know if you've noticed, but it's been a while since the last article. Today
        I'll kind of explain why these last couple of weeks
        I haven't created any new article.
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineering and
        many other things, and today's topic is about <b>using the Spaced Repetition System</b>
        to boost your learning process.
    </p>
    <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
    <p>
        The learning curve theory is a way of visualizing how proficient
        someone is at something, at a task. The idea is that, themore
        experience one have doing something, themore proficient he/she
        is going to be on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        A classic example of this scenario is with employee perfomance
        visualization. Themore experience the employee has performing
        a task, the more proficiente he/she is.
        <br>
        Another good example would be with exercises, themore experience
        one have doing push ups, themore proficient he/she will be.
        Another one with language, themore someone speaks a language,
        themore proficient he's/he's will become with the speaking skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experience part can be directly related to time,
        for instance, themore time someone spends speaking a language, themore
        proficient he/she becomes.
        <br>
        But it also can be indirectly realted to time, themore words someone
        knows about a language, the more proficient he/she becomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The proficiency can be directly related to time, for instance,
        the more experienced someone is with maratons, the less time
        he/she will take to get to the end of the line. In this case, the gradient
        will be in a decreasing visualization.
        <br>
        It can also be indirectly related to time, themore words someone knows about
        a language (experience), themore phrases he/she can built. 
    </p>

    <p>
        At first the expected is that one takes a great investiment to acquire
        experience and then, have a bit of proficiency. This also means that
        a great investiment will be put in the beginning, with almost no return.
        <br>
        As one aqcuire more experience, the proficiency grows therefore the
        return will come with less investiment.

    <h3>Forgetting Curve: Information Retention</h3>
    <p>
        One thing that have been bothering since I entered in the journey of
        learning things, specially programming is <b>forgetting what took me so long to learn</b>.
        I gotta tell you, this really worries me sometimes. It's not possible to
        memorize 100% of everything, I know that. My worries generally is with
        things that I really consider important.
    </p>
    <p>
        Very well, there is a very known hipothesis developed by a German Psychologist
        called <b>forgetting curve</b>. This hipothesis, is a visualization, a graph,
        of the information lost over the time. In other words, it's a graph that
        shows the information we forgert as the time goes on, if not attempt to retain
        it is made.
    </p>
    <img class="post-img" src="images/srs/forgetting-curve.svg" alt="">
    <h3>Learning Programming, concepts and tools around it</h3>
    <p>
        So, as i told you before, i've been on this journey of acquiring
        knowledge for a decent amount of time. During this time i had to
        understand a few things that weren't directly related to the things
        was learning at the time. My sleep for instance, i discovered
        the amount of hours i can sleep per night in average in diffrent moments
        and contexts. If i go through a very energy consuming day at my job,
        beign for stress or because the problem demanded more effort to solve than usual,
        i'm pretty sure that i'll sleep a bit more than usual. Or if i'm very
        excited about something, i'll probably fall at sleep very late in the
        night.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also realized that to achieve the results I wantend, I would
        have to create my own process, instead of copying someone else's
        process. I tried, and it didn't worked for some simple reasons:
        everyone has a different context. With context i mean, routine,
        different financial problems, culture and so on.
        So trying to literally copy someone else's process and following
        it lead me to a frustration, for the simpole fact that the process was made to
        satisfy someone else's context, not mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that being said, i also had to learn that there are different ways
        of learning different things. The way you learned to walk is different the
        way you learned to talk, but even with different aprroaches, the
        learning curve theory and the forgetting curve hythesis apply well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For programming it's not
        different. Some things you gotta memorize, but others like
        syntax, the way a for loop is built in JavaScript for instance,
        you don't have to. So it's important to have proficiency in
        <b>how to learn things</b> and it's also important
        to <b>memorize more conceptual</b> things. So I had to create
        some processes and habits to increase my profiency in
        <b>learning new things</b> and I also had to find a way of
        not forgetting what i've learned. That's when I thought "what if i tried
        Spaced Repetion for programming?".
    </p>
    <h3>Spaced Repetition System</h3>
    <p>
        The forgetting curve hypothesis is a visualization of information
        lost over time, if there is <b>no attempt to retain it</b>. The
        spaced repetition is a technique, it's this "attempt" to retain information.
        The way it works is very simple, one just have to revisit some information
        he/she is trying to memorize, in spaced intervals and everytime the topic is revisited, less
        information is lost over time, till the information is fully memorized or a sufficient
        amount of information is retanined.
    </p>
    <img class="post-img" src="images/srs/spaced-repetition-technique.svg" alt="">
    <p>
        This technique improves the long-term memory and can be used with different things, with
        different applications. I used it with flash cards for acquiring vocabulary in English.
        I also used the flashcards for memorizing some network concepts, didn't workout as well
        as it did with English.
    </p>
    <h4>The Feynmen Technique, blog posts and the Spaced Repetition</h4>
    <p>
        Recently i've realized that what i've been doing is a mix of these three things.
        There are things that I write about in which I already knew because I've learned
        in some moment in the past. But others i really have to discover, i have to learn.
        <br>
        So my approach to learn new things is to use the Feynmen technique. Before
        wrting any articles, i learn the points that I don't know using the technique.
        This technique is composes by 5 simple steps:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Try to understand the topic
                    the best way you can</b>, as you usually would do. Read articles, go after books,
                    videos, classes, Q&A etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Try to explain the topic, as if you were teaching to someone</b>. Imagine you're
                trying to explain to a kid. You're going to write down the explaination is
                some piece of paper or into your computer as you explain speaking out loud.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>After going through the 2 step</b>, if you forgot something or found it hard to remember
                anything, go back to the step number 1 and do all over again util you don't forget
                anything and find it relatively easy to explaing it. Be critical about it, if you
                want to learn it, you gotta be honest with yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Now explain it out loud, without writing it down</b>. Be creative, use analogies and
                imagine you're explaining the topic to another person. Keep it simple, imagine
                you're exaplaining it to a child. If you forgot something or found it
                hard to remember things, go back to step number 1 and go through the process all over again.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat the process until you've masterd the topic.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been using this technique for quite a while now. To be honest with you,
        i didn't expect it to work at first, but it did with almost everything.
        Writing the blog post is like the 6th step for me.
        I also try to structure the article in subheads so that i can easily find the topics
        i have to revist after sometime.
    </p>
    <p>
        These last couple of months i created the habit of prioritizing the information
        i want to retain. Not everything you read in a book for isntance, will be need
        to accomplish what you want. Maybe just going through the first chapter is enough.
        I strongly recommend you to be critical about what you're trying to retain. If
        it's not going to be used right now, it's just time lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        Knowledge is "power", but acquiring knowledge just for the sake of acquiring it,
        is not as smart as it seems. It's like buying super luxurious cars without knowing
        how to drive, it just doesn't makes sense. If the information is important, you won't forget.
    </p>
    Good Luck XD
