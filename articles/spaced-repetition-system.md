        A couple of years ago I discovered that didn't know how
        to learn things, including programming and english. If you don't know,
        english is not my native language. Of course this is an evolutive process.
        There are many stuff that we must learn using different approaches.
        But many things can be learned by using basically the same
        technique.

        I don't know if you've noticed, but it's been a while since the last article. Today
        I'll kind of explain why these last couple of weeks
        I haven't created any new article.

        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineering and
        many other things, and today's topic is about <b>using the Spaced Repetition System</b>
        to boost your learning process.

    <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
    <p>
        The learning curve theory is a way of visualizing how proeficient
        someone is at something, at a task. The idea is that, themore
        experience one have doing something, themore proeficient he/she
        is going to be on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        A classic example of this scenario is with employee perfomance
        visualization. Themore experience the employee has performing
        a task, the more proeficiente he/she is.
        <br>
        Another good example would be with exercises, themore experience
        one have doing push ups, themore proeficient he/she will be.
        Another one with language, themore someone speaks a language,
        themore proeficient he's/he's will become with the speaking skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experience part can be directly related to time,
        for instance, themore time someone spends speaking a language, themore
        proeficient he/she becomes.
        <br>
        But it also can be indirectly realted to time, themore words someone
        knows about a language, the more proeficient he/she becomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The proeficiency can be directly related to time, for instance,
        the more experienced someone is with maratons, the less time
        he/she will take to get to the end of the line. In this case, the gradient
        will be in a decreasing visualization.
        <br>
        It can also be indirectly related to time, themore words someone knows about
        a language (experience), themore phrases he/she can built. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At first the expected is that one takes a great investiment to acquire
        experience and then, have a bit of proeficiency. This also means that
        a great investiment will be put in the beginning, with almost no return.
        <br>
        As one aqcuire more experience, the proeficiency grows therefore the
        return will come with less investiment.

    Good Luck XD
