        A couple of years ago I discovered that didn't know how
        to learn things, including programming and english. If you don't know,
        english is not my native language. Of course this is an evolutive process.
        There are many stuff that we must learn using different approaches.
        But many things can be learned by using basically the same
        technique.

        I don't know if you've noticed, but it's been a while since the last article. Today
        I'll kind of explain why these last couple of weeks
        I haven't created any new article.

        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineering and
        many other things, and today's topic is about <b>using the Spaced Repetition System</b>
        to boost your learning process.
    </p>
    <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
    <p>
        The learning curve theory is a way of visualizing how proficient
        someone is at something, at a task. The idea is that, themore
        experience one have doing something, themore proficient he/she
        is going to be on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        A classic example of this scenario is with employee perfomance
        visualization. Themore experience the employee has performing
        a task, the more proficiente he/she is.
        <br>
        Another good example would be with exercises, themore experience
        one have doing push ups, themore proficient he/she will be.
        Another one with language, themore someone speaks a language,
        themore proficient he's/he's will become with the speaking skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experience part can be directly related to time,
        for instance, themore time someone spends speaking a language, themore
        proficient he/she becomes.
        <br>
        But it also can be indirectly realted to time, themore words someone
        knows about a language, the more proficient he/she becomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The proficiency can be directly related to time, for instance,
        the more experienced someone is with maratons, the less time
        he/she will take to get to the end of the line. In this case, the gradient
        will be in a decreasing visualization.
        <br>
        It can also be indirectly related to time, themore words someone knows about
        a language (experience), themore phrases he/she can built. 
    </p>

        At first the expected is that one takes a great investiment to acquire
        experience and then, have a bit of proficiency. This also means that
        a great investiment will be put in the beginning, with almost no return.
        <br>
        As one aqcuire more experience, the proficiency grows therefore the
        return will come with less investiment.

    <h3>Forgetting Curve: Information Retention</h3>
    <p>
        One thing that have been bothering since I entered in the journey of
        learning things, specially programming is <b>forgetting what took me so long to learn</b>.
        I gotta tell you, this really worries me sometimes. It's not possible to
        memorize 100% of everything, I know that. My worries generally is with
        things that I really consider important.
    </p>
    <p>
        Very well, there is a very known hipothesis developed by a German Psychologist
        called <b>forgetting curve</b>. This hipothesis, is a visualization, a graph,
        of the information lost over the time. In other words, it's a graph that
        shows the information we forgert as the time goes on, if not attempt to retain
        it is made.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning Programming, concepts and tools around it</h3>
    <p>
        So, as i told you before, i've been on this journey of acquiring
        knowledge for a decent amount of time. During this time i had to
        understand a few things that weren't directly related to the things
        was learning at the time. My sleep for instance, i discovered
        the amount of hours i can sleep per night in average in diffrent moments
        and contexts. If i go through a very energy consuming day at my job,
        beign for stress or because the problem demanded more effort to solve than usual,
        i'm pretty sure that i'll sleep a bit more than usual. Or if i'm very
        excited about something, i'll probably fall at sleep very late in the
        night.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also realized that to achieve the results I wantend, I would
        have to create my own process, instead of copying someone else's
        process. I tried, and it didn't worked for some simple reasons:
        everyone has a different context. With context i mean, routine,
        different financial problems, culture and so on.
        So trying to literally copy someone else's process and following
        it lead me to a frustration, for the simpole fact that the process was made to
        satisfy someone else's context, not mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that being said, i also had to learn that there are different ways
        of learning different things. The way you learned to walk is different the
        way you learned to talk, but even with different aprroaches, the
        learning curve theory and the forgetting curve hythesis apply well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For programming it's not
        different. Some things you gotta memorize, but others like
        syntax, the way a for loop is built in JavaScript for instance,
        you don't have to. So it's important to have proficiency in
        <b>how to learn things</b> and it's also important
        to <b>memorize more conceptual</b> things. So I had to create
        some processes and habits to increase my profiency in
        <b>learning new things</b> and I also had to find a way of
        not forgetting what i've learned. That's when I thought "what if i tried
        Spaced Repetion for programming?".
    </p>
    <h3>Spaced Repetition System</h3>
    <p>
        The forgetting curve hypothesis is a visualization of information
        lost over time, if there is <b>no attempt to retain it</b>. The
        spaced repetition is a technique, it's this "attempt" to retain information.
        The way it works is very simple, one just have to revisit some topic
        he/she is trying to memorize, and everytime the topic is revisited, less
        information is lost over time, till the information is fully memorized.

    Good Luck XD
