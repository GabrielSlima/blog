        The <a href="https://gabrielslima.github.io/blog/post.html?id=23" target="blank">last article</a> I've talked about Requirements
        Analysis, the first stage from the SDLC (Software Development Life-Cycle).
        If you haven't read it I'll give a summary but I strongly
        recommend you reading it before you read this one.

        Welcome to the piewdiepie's favourite blog about Software Engineering
        and today's topic is <strong>Techines for Requirements Analysis</strong>.
        Let's get started.
    </p>
    <p>
        The analysis stage is intended to identify and document problems.
        With the problemas documentend the designers can work
        to find Software solutions. Every analysis activity is
        intended to create a model of the system that is idenpedent
        of implementation rules. This means that the problems are
        documented thiking about business process and specific needs
        the system must satisfy.
    </p>
    <p>
        This stage is composed mainly by 3 types of activities:
        Requirements discovery/gathering, documenting and analysis.
        Requirements can be discovered and documented all at once.
        The goal here is to understand and record business processes
        and specific system needs. This process may include
        stakeholders interviews.
        Every requirement must be analysed to guarantee that a set of
        good requirements were defined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Requirements can be documented using lists, natural language
        documents, data models, use cases, user stories and so on.
        A good requirement has the following characteristics:
        Atomic, testable/verifiable, consistend and unambiguous, 
        uniquely identified, traceable and complete.

    <h3>UML - Unified Modeling Language</h3>
    <p>
        The Unified Modeling Language is a modeling language for
        creating diagrams that represents a system. In other
        words, it represents what the system has.
    </p>
    <h3>Use Cases</h3>
    <p>
        UML digrams represents what the system has. It represents the
        system's design.
        Use Cases are diagrams used to represent how users interact with
        the system or how other systems interact with it. In other words,
        it represents situations where a piece of the software will be used,
        behaviors/processes within the system and how they are executed.

    <h3>User Story</h3>
    <p>
        User Story is a natural language description of a feature
        or functionality or requirement in general that
        affects an existing or requires a new feature or functionality
        within the software. It's written from a end user's perspective
        and can be documented on cards or post-it notes.

    <h3>Flowcharts</h3>
    <p>
        Flowcharts are diagrams for representing a process or a
        workflow. It's sequential and can be used by technical
        or non-technical people.
        It's a representation of a process or workflow step-by-step.
