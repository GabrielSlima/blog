        I was talking to this person the other day, and because we've just met,
        a few interesting topics came up in the conversation. And while I was talking
        to her, I actively thinking about some things that I was dealing with at
        my personal and professional life. In that moment actually I was dealing with
        one of the things that I've been dealing for a long time now, <i>inscurity</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favorite blog about Software Engineering, and
        today is not your average content my friend, today we'll talk a little
        about <i>starting things even if you feel ready</i>. Let's dive into it.
    </p>
    <h3>Do your thing, do not seek someone else's approval</h3>
    <p>
        One thing I did a lot in the past, and sometimes I get myself doing,
        is seek someone else's approval torwards something I'm doing.
        In my country it was super common to work in IT Support then switch to
        another thing, programming for instance. And for a while I was seeking approval
        from people I really saw as a model, people I kind of wanted to be like and
        actually did some interviews in IT Support, but what I really wanted was to my first
        job in IT to be programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bruh the feeling was consumming me inside out. I remember being on this interview
        and I wasn't fully present, I knew it was time lost, I wouldn't be able to
        get the job because I really didn't wanted it. That day I knew what I had to do,
        I had to sit down, stablish a plan, stick to and know all I could about
        getting my first job as a Software Engineer and it worked!
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem with seeking other people's approval is that they're
        going to give you advices based on their experiences and opinion.
        And the actual problem here is that maybe those advices comes with
        frustration, and may prevent you from having your own experiences.
        You cannot expect someone else knows what is best for you because you
        are the only one who can actually say that.
    </p>
    <h3>No negative affirmations</h3>
    <p>
        Thoughts can't be 100% controlled 100% of the time, you just have them.
        But you sure can control their source. You can threat those sources and heal.
        One interesting thing that is happening these last few days, I've been
        having nightmares during my sleep. And it's curious because it's been
        a while since the last time I had a nightmare. It makes me wonder why I'm having
        them again.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be honest with you, the nightmares brought me back some memories.
        Memories of things I've done in the past I'm not proud of. Memories
        that are source of many of my insecurities. Brought me back ghosts
        and negative affirmations with them.
        <br>
        I have to deal with them. I have to understand the source, the <i>why</i>,
        the reason behind those emotions and detach the emotion from the
        memory, so it becomes just a memory, just an experience and
        a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
        Exploring your thoughts to find the reason you're thiking the way you do,
        it's not an easy job. It takes a while to actually understand
        how your own mind works and the best way I found to do this is
        by journaling and practicing mindfulness. I actually use these techniques
        in some situations now, for instance, whenver I'm feeling anxious, angry,
        with this mental fogginess or I'm feeling sad, I just take some time
        to write down my thoughts. It's essential that you externalize everything
        that is on your mind. It's a good thing to externalize them by writting.
        <br>
        And whenever I get myself mindwandering, I bring myself back to the present.
        So it's a good practice to take 10 minutes everyday and practice this.
        When I started I would get a cup of tea, sit on my porch and invest a few minutes
        practicing. Now is a involuntary thing. It became a habit. Whenever I find myself
        lost on my thoughts, that I've lost touch with reallity, I bring myself back.
    </p>
    <h3>Don't judge, don't make fun of people, don't talk behind people's back and don't put limiting beliefs on others</h3>
    <p>
        To summarize this topic, don't be toxic. You ever had this weird feeling
        you carry on when talking to people, you kind of feel guilty for being nice and kind
        to someone when on your mind you're supposed to be angry with them, maybe this
        hate? You feel this becasue you're being toxic and you either are judging, making fun,
        putting limiting beliefs on them uncounciously or you actually at some point
        was doing practicing those things actively. You shoud stop.
    </p>
    <p>
        I found my self being super
        toxic the past few weeks with people around me. Calling people names, like
        dumb and related things and reaffirming this by constatly asking them
        things they don't know on purpose. I know why I acted that way, and I'm not
        proud of it. If you are a man, or identify as one, you're supposed to be
        a gentlemen, you shoud be kind and support people. You're not
        supposed to play on other people's insecurities. You're not supposed to
        make fun of people to feel good. You should be the guy
        who helps people with the intention of helping them and don't expect
        anything in return. You should do good because it's the right thing to
        be done. You're not being a nice guy, you're being a gentlemen.
    </p>
    <h3>Overly critize people and toxic relationships</h3>
    <p>
        I was being toxic, and I realised it because it's not me anymore. It's not
        part of my habits to be a toxic person anymore, it's not natural for me. But
        being toxic was my natural state a few years a go, before I started
        my self improvement journey to be honest. Actively thinking, maybe this is
        result of my environment.
        <br>
        I Found myself in a environment where people
        always knows what is best for everyone. They're constatly criticizing things,
        and took me a while to realize that I am a critical person and how to
        properly behave torwards the world around me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overly criticizing people makes other people to feel bad. There's always
        something bad about something. Nothing is never good. If you identify yourself
        as a over criticizing person, you should be seeking to improve that area.
        You should people the person people want around.
        <br>
        If you have relationship with people that is constatly criticizing you, you should
        set boundaries. There's some ways of doing this, i'm not an expert, the way
        I've been dealing with this is by cutting those people from my life once
        I've realised they do this on purpose. When I realise someone is doing this uncounciously,
        I do tell them, I'm like "Why are you being so critical?
        You shoud enjoy the moment broh. Nothing is perfect,
        never will be, and if you continue this path, you'll never be trully happy". And show
        them that there's a better way. If they want to learn of course. If don't,
        I just walk away. It's not your job to change people.
    </p>
    <h4>Unbreakable image and values</h4>
    <p>
        If you can't just cut some of those people from your life,
        you should have Unbreakable values and opinions. This is a
        dangerous path because you can become an intolerant person
        that rejects everything people has to say. That's not the goal here.
        The goal here is to stop listening to people. You're who you wanna be.
        Not what people say you are. So this is gonna take a while to develop,
        but the goal is to get so busy with your self improvement journey,
        with your business, your body's health, mental health, that
        you won't have time for other's people criticism. You're gonna hear
        it, but you're automatically ignoring it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The negative thoughts will sure reach you, but you're constatly threating them journaling,
        by working on your self image and reaffirming them with your routine.
        The criticism and toxicity will be blocked naturally.
        There is this book called <i>Psychocybernetics, from Maxwell Maltz</i>, and it's
        all about self image. Strongly recommend it.
    </p>
    Good Luck XD
