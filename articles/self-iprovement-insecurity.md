        I was talking to this person the other day, and because we've just met,
        a few interesting topics came up in the conversation. And while I was talking
        to her, I was actively thinking about some things that I was dealing with at
        my personal and professional life. In that moment actually, the exact moment
        the conversation was happening, I was dealing with
        one of the things that I've been dealing for a long time now, <i>insecurity</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favorite blog about Software Engineering, and
        today is not your average content my friend, today we'll talk a little
        about <i>starting things even if you don't feel ready</i>. Let's dive into it.
    </p>
    <h2>Self image, insecurities and toxicity</h2>
    <p>
        Most of the time all this fear, all this uncertainty about
        doing things, can come from the way you think people think
        about you. Can come from the way you see yourself. Can come
        from the people you have around you.
    </p>
    <p>
        This affects everything, from learning new things you never
        heard of, maybe you're switching careers, maybe you're just
        experimenting new things. And can go to things related to what
        you are actually profcient at but maybe
        you have some new experiences you wanna acquire around them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe you got promoted, maybe your day to day job requires
        you learning new skills for instance. Or you
        just wanna take a small trip and you've never experienced traveling in
        an airplane.
        <br>
        Whatever it's you're going through or may go through some day,
        all of them can be affected by insecurities, toxic people or environment. So
        at least from my perspective, going through these topics
        is very important.
    </p>
    <h3>Do your thing, do not seek someone else's approval</h3>

    <p>
        One thing I did a lot in the past, and sometimes I get myself doing nowdays,
        is <b>to seek someone else's approval</b> torwards something I'm doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few years ago, at least In my country, 
        it was super common to work in IT Support then switch to
        another thing, programming for instance. And for a while I was seeking approval
        from people I really saw as a model, people I kind of wanted to be like in the past.
        And I actually landed some interviews in IT Support, but what I really wanted was to my first
        job in IT to be in IT programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bruh the feeling was consumming me inside out. I remember being on this interview
        and I wasn't fully present, I knew it was time lost, I wouldn't be able to
        get the job because I really didn't wanted it. That day I knew what I had to do,
        I had to sit down, created a plan, stick to and know all I could about
        getting my first job as a Software Engineer and it worked!
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem with seeking other people's approval is that they're
        going to give you advices based on their experiences and opinion.
        And the actual problem here is that, maybe those advices comes with
        frustration, and may prevent you from having your own experiences.
        You cannot expect someone else knows what is best for you because you
        are the only one who can actually say that.
    </p>
    <h3>No negative affirmations</h3>
    <figure>
        <img class="post-img" src="images/self-improvement-insecurity/journaling.jpg" alt="Table with a cup of tea, a notes book and a hand writing on it.">

    </figure>
    <p>
        Thoughts can't be 100% controlled 100% of the time, you just have them.
        But you sure can control their source. You can threat those sources and heal.
    </p>
    <p>
        One interesting thing that is happening these last few days, I've been
        having nightmares during my sleep. And it's curious because it's been
        a while since the last time I had a nightmare. It makes me wonder why I'm having
        them again.
    </p>
    <p>
        To be honest with you, the nightmares brought me back some memories.
        Memories of things I've done in the past I'm not proud of. Memories
        of shame and traumas. Memories
        that are source of many of my insecurities. Brought me back ghosts
        and negative affirmations with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have to deal with them. I have to understand the source, the <i>why</i>,
        the reason behind those emotions and detach the emotion from the
        memory, so it becomes just a memory, just an experience and
        a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
        Exploring your thoughts to find the reason you're thiking the way you do,
        it's not an easy job. It takes a while to actually understand
        how your own mind works and the best way I found to do this is
        by journaling and practicing mindfulness. I actually use these techniques
        in some specific situations now. For instance, whenever I'm feeling anxious, angry,
        with this mental fogginess or I'm feeling sad, I just take some time
        to write down my thoughts. It's essential that you externalize everything
        that is on your mind. And it's also a good thing to externalize them by writting.
    </p>
    <p>
        And whenever I get myself mindwandering, I bring myself back to the present.
        So it's a good practice to take 10 minutes everyday and practice this.
        When I started I would get a cup of tea, sit on my porch and invest a few minutes
        practicing. Now is an involuntary thing. It became a habit. Whenever I find myself
        lost on my thoughts, that I've lost touch with reallity, I bring myself back.
    </p>
    <h3>Don't judge, don't make fun of people, don't talk behind people's back and don't put limiting beliefs on others</h3>
    <figure>

    <p>
        To summarize this topic, don't be toxic. You ever had this weird feeling
        you carry on when talking to people, you kind of feel guilty for being nice and kind
        to someone when on your mind you're supposed to be angry with them, maybe feel
        hate? You feel this becasue you're being toxic, and you either are judging, making fun,
        putting limiting beliefs on them uncounciously, or you actually, at some point,
        was practicing those things actively. You shoud stop.
    </p>
    <p>
        I found my self being super
        toxic the past few weeks with people around me. Calling people names, like
        dumb and related things and reaffirming this by constatly asking them
        things they don't know on purpose. I know why I acted that way, and I'm not
        proud of it. If you are a man, or identify as one or if you're a woman or identify as one,
        you're supposed to be a gentlemen/lady, you shoud be kind and support people.
    </p>
    <p>
        You're not
        supposed to play on other people's insecurities. You're not supposed to
        make fun of people to feel good. You should be the person
        who helps people with the intention of helping them and not expecting
        anything in return. You should do good because it's the right thing to
        be done. You're not being a nice guy/girl, you're being a gentlemen/lady.
    </p>
    <h3>Overly critical people and toxic relationships</h3>
    <p>
        I was being toxic, and I realized it because it's not me anymore. It's not
        part of my habits to be a toxic person anymore, it's not natural for me. But
        being toxic was my natural state a few years a go, before I started
        my self improvement journey to be honest. Actively thinking, maybe this is
        a result of my environment.
        <br>
        I Found myself in a environment where people
        always knows what is best for everyone. They're constatly criticizing things,
        and took me a while to realize that I am a critical person and how to
        properly behave torwards the world around me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overly critical people makes other people to feel bad. There's always
        something bad about something. Nothing is ever good. If you identify yourself
        as a <i>overly critical person</i>, you should be seeking to improve that area of your life.
        You should be the person people want around, not the person people want to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have relationship with people that is constatly criticizing you, you should
        set boundaries. There's some ways of doing this, i'm not an expert, the way
        I've been dealing with this is by cutting those people from my life once
        I've realized they do this on purpose. When I realize someone is doing this uncounciously,
        I do tell them, I'm like "Why are you being so critical?
        You shoud enjoy the moment broh. Nothing is perfect,
        never will be, and if you continue this path, you'll never be trully happy". And show
        them that there's a better way. If they want to learn of course. If don't,
        I just walk away. It's not my or yours job to change people.
    </p>
    <h4>Unbreakable image and values</h4>
    <p>
        If you can't just cut some of those people from your life,
        you should have Unbreakable values and opinions. This is a
        dangerous path because you can become an intolerant person
        that rejects everything people has to say. That's not the goal here.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal here is to stop listening to people. You're who you wanna be.
        Not what people say you are. So this is gonna take a while to develop,
        but the goal is to get so busy with your self improvement journey,
        with your business, with your body's health, with your mental health, that
        you won't have time for other's people criticism. You're gonna hear
        it, but you're automatically ignoring it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The negative thoughts will sure reach you, but you're constatly threating them journaling,
        by working on your self image and reaffirming them with your routine.
        The criticism and toxicity will be blocked naturally.
        There is this book called <i>Psychocybernetics, from Maxwell Maltz</i>, and it's
        all about self image. Strongly recommend it.
    </p>
    <h2>When you feel insecure about anything, do it anyways</h2>

    <h3>For things you see an opportunity: practice with projects</h3>
    <p>
        Whenever you see an opportunity to implement something, do it. You'll struggle,
        you'll face problems that seems unsovable but believe me, they are, even
        you have to recreate something from scratch, switch components or
        just change the way you're doing things. Every problem has a solution.
        Even you have to create another version of something.
    </p>
    <p>
        By implementing things, and actually  going through the problems, Googling
        your questions, reading documentation, reading the source code of components,
        libs, APIs and actually exploring and discovering whatever it's your doing,
        you'll acquire so much experience. You'll probably forget almost everything
        next morning, but the important things, process, the ability to learn
        new things is overall improved because of this. So make sure to always implement,
        at leas partially, what you're trying to accomplish. Doesn't have
        to be perfect, what you're seeking here is the practical experience.
    </p>
    <h3>Dealing with difficult things you probably can't implement easily</h3>
    <p>
        I was working on a project a while ago where I had to support this application,
        without fully understanding it first. I had to understand it whithout
        implementing things beforehand and this made everything harder because people were
        bringing me issues I didn't had a way of reproducing it easily, first because
        i've never seen it, second because we don't have a "test environment". And it
        wasn't possible to create a local environment on my laptop,
        because the application was too complex to be installed on a local environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I did was to go through the application's configuration
        on "test" instances and I was interpreting the configuration alongside
        the vendor's official documentation to understand what was happening. Don't
        get me wrong, I wasn't supposed to be using this "test environment", because
        it was someone else's test environment, but after going trough
        the documentation and switching one thing here and there, I felt confident enough
        to solve problems or redirect them for the responsibles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now although this is not 100% solving problems without implementing things,
        I didn't have to reinstall the application on any environment, and I was
        addressing the issues better everytime I used this approach to solve brand new
        problems.
    </p>
    <h3>Don't be afraid to make mistakes. But don't be negligent either</h3>
    <p>
        I remember my first job interviews, I was overthinking about
        making mistakes, about saying something the person iterviewing me
        would not like. I was like that for years actually. Even after getting
        the job I was too worried about what other people would think of me
        if I made any mistake, what would happen and etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Broh, relax. You <i>don't have</i> to be right all the time. Actually the person
        that is struggling and having a hard time with things, will probably end up
        mastering those things. Because he/she is
        struggling so much, requires more attention, more research and more time dedicated
        to deal and process everything.
        I'm not telling you to fail on purpose, because you're actually being
        careless and not really considering the real consequences and end up in a mess.
        <br>
        But what i'm telling you is, do it. Try and implement things,
        make sure you're confortable with your decisions and that you're aware of
        the consequences if something goes wrong. Not necessarilly gotta think
        everything through beforehand, but you're also being cautions to
        acquire experience in a context where you don't feel too much scared to do anything,
        because you don't know the consequences and therefore can't think of anything
        to turn around the situations.
    </p>
    <h4>Don't be afraid to break things</h4>
    <p>
        Maybe this is one of the most crucial fear I've overcome the past few years,
        and during this process, I had some people reaffirming it,
        involuntary just because I've decided to take the boat's control
        and go around with it.
        <br>
        I remember being at this project which was pretty interesting by the way,
        and this project specifically only had me as developer. And I had to 
        support existing features and create new things. I was too afraid to
        touch anything and break the entire system. But the job had to be done and
        I was always being cautions and negotiating dates with the client. Fortunatelly
        they were very empathetic torwards me, so lucky me.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the point is, every change, every new thing I had to add or
        everything I had to delete or disable, I did make sure I was
        negotiating enough time to actually understand things, and change stuff.
        At my first job at this project I asked them for a simpler task
        because I wanted to have enough time to get used with the system, before
        making bigger changes. After a few weeks, I was feeling more confortable to
        make changes, but one chage was bigger than the other so it was kind of scary. 
        the insecurity was always tehere.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything changed after I talked to this other developer. He was
        working on another project, dealing with a different context. And I started
        to build a relationship with him, by asking him if I could learn some things from him.
        One day I asked him, "bruh, I'm kind of scared of changing stuff around. I
        don't wanna break anything". And he was like "My brother, you think I'm not
        kind of scared too? Of course I'm. I can change something and break the whole system.
        This is how it goes. Fear is a good thing, because you don't make dumb decisions.
        But it can't consume you. Of course you gotta be prudent, test everything before deploying
        anything, but someone gotta go through this and do it. Why not me? Why not you? Go ahead.
        If you make some mistake and end up breaking stuff, fix it, or call someone who will
        help you. That's it".
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't be afraid to break the things. Before deploying anything, you have to test it
        in some way. Even if you can't, let's say you have a production problem and
        you only have this environment to work with, no option to try things
        on your local environment, you'll probably have to implement things
        during the night, so you don't impact anything else. If you break something,
        fix it.
    </p>
    <h3>Try to detach yourself from time</h3>
    <p>
        Time was one the things that were my enemy when I was just starting
        this fight against insecurity. Having a specific time to do things
        may help some people, but for me made everything worse. Knowing
        I had an specific amount of time to do something would remove
        my focus from what I was supposed to do and thing of the
        consequences of not doing it on the specified time.
    </p>
    <p>
        This made me feel more anxious and pontecialized all the insecurities
        I had. And even worse, I was constatly visualizing failure at the end,
        and sometimes those failures became true.
        <br>
        It's important that you detach yourself from the time you have to do things.
        I'm not telling you to spend weeks and weeks on purpose. I'm telling
        you to things one step after the other, doing only one thing at a time.
        And if you exceed the time specified before hand, deal with the consequences.
    </p>
    <h4>Ask for help</h4>
    <p>
        If what you're doing evolves money and contracts with the client, do
        what you can and if you see that you're spending too much time on something.
        Maybe you're stuck or it's just too many things to deal with,
        ask for help. Maybe it's your coworkers, maybe it's a friend, a colleague
        or it's Google. Just go ahead and ask for help. For the most part,
        people are very nice on helping others. Yeah sure, sometimes you come accross
        someone who is not willing to help you, and that's ok. Try someone else or
        on another platform if you're looking for help on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also consider reading books, official documentation and tutorials on the internet.
        Those things may help you a lot.
    </p>
    <h3>Final Words</h3>
    <p>
        There are quite a few things I've tried in the past to deal with
        insecurities. And there's a few things I still practice today,
        because I still deal with insecurities in many aspects of my life.
        <br>
        But hopefully I could help you with some ideas or maybe
        just by sharing that you're not alone. There's a lot of
        people going through the same issues we are right now. We just
        gotta find them and share experiences.
    </p>
    Good Luck XD
