        Hey good to have you here again and if you're reading this,
        you probably is looking for answers on why you're feeling stressed out,
        maybe you're not learning things the way you wanted to.
        Maybe you're not thinking straight, you have this fogginess.
        Or you are just curious. Whatever motive you have to be here, I would like
        to share with you things that worked for me and maybe can work for you too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to PiewediePie's favorite blog about software engineering and today's not
        your average content. Today we're talking about <b>how to raise your vibration</b>.
        Let's get into it!
    </p>
    <h3>Get rid of limiting beliefs</h3>
    <p>
        First of all I would like to start by saying that your limiting beliefs
        will prevent you from achieving things you want and eventually,
        make you miserable. I've been through this myself, still do and
        still fight against them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have you ever thought that you're not cut out for something? Maybe
        because you've failed so many times or beucase someone else failed
        and they've put their limiting beliefs on you, sounds about right?
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll talk (more like write) about this type of people
        in a few moments. But you should fight those limiting beliefs,
        that you can't, that you don't have what's required to do the things
        you wanna do, that's impossible and that it's hard becasue you've failed or
        because someone failed and made you belief on their perspective.
        You gotta fight this. You gotta fight the negative beliefs, not
        by literally fighting or arguing with the other person, but by being self
        aware and self councious and having a bulletproof mind.
        We're after what is impossible. If it was easy anyone would do. 
    </p>
    <h4>Embrace your suckness</h4>
    <p>
        Think of some area or any goal you've set for yourself that you're struggling.
        For instance, I'm struggling to wake up ealier than usual, and reorganize my
        sleeping routine, therefore reorganizing a few things in my schedule. I can wake
        up ealier for 2 to 3 straight, but at some point, I can't sleep earlier,
        end up going to sleep 1am - 2am and the other day I wake up 2 hours later
        than I was supposed to. That sucks. I suck at this and I've been struggling for
        a few weeks now, since I decided to change a few things on my routine. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea here is not to make you worse, is to be realistic. We can't let
        failures define and dictate our lives. To the contrary, we must accept that
        we've failed and we suck at whatever we're doing and trying different things.
        Just Google it, someone on the internet must being through what you're being
        through right now and may give you a different perspective.
    </p>
    <h4>Mapping your limiting beliefs (Journaling)</h4>
    <img class="post-img" src="images/self-improvement-raising-your-vibration/journal.jpg" alt="Journal photo with a lotus flower. Used to map negative thoughts and help to understand myself">
    <p>
        You have to map all of your limiting beliefs as well as your negative thoughts
        to understand the root cause. Doesn't have to be everyday, doesn't have to be
        every 2 hours of your day, and doesn't have to be fancy. Just get a paper, a notes
        book and start writing how you are feeling, what you are feeling and try to
        understand "why".
    </p>
    <p>
        I have this book, whenever I feel anxious, stressed, worried, I write my thoughts and
        feelings down with the purpose of identifying why am I feeling those things.
    </p>
    <h4>Take immeadiate action or don't worry about it</h4>
    <p>
        Have you ever experienced sleep deprivation because you was worried about
        something? Maybe you was supposed to do something but you couldn't for
        any reason or maybe you was thinking about situations you've had said
        something and felt guilty about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If something is bothering you, you should solve it. If you can't means it's not fully
        under your control, let it go. It takes practice but you'll get there eventually.
        Don't let anything get on your way and prevent you from doing the things you've planned
        to do. I'm not saying for you to become a jerk, all I'm saying is to you to
        recognize things are under your control and solve them, and stop worry
        about things that you can't control.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few weeks ago I found myself complaining about the weather because it wasn't
        the way I wish it was etc. I can't control the weather so it doesn't
        makes sense to be mad at it. It's energy lost. Accept what you can't change and
        please <b>bea reasonable about it</b>, do not use your limiting beliefs
        to support the idea that you can't control something that you actually can.
    </p>
    <h3>Get your body moving</h3>
    <figure>
        <img class="post-img" src="images/self-improvement-raising-your-vibration/push-up-pexels.jpg" alt="Man doing push ups">
        <figcaption class="external-photo-figcaption">Photo by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@carlos-montelara-3450804/" target="blank">@Carlos Montelara</a> - Pexels</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        If you tend to be or in fact is a sendentary you should get your body moving.
        If you find ok to be sitting the entire day, watching movies, working or actually just doing
        nothing at all, that's on you. I find it super stressful and confortable at the same
        time to go through my entire day, spending my life sitting or laying down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Right after waking up don't even thing about it, 10 push ups. Next week do 20 the
        week after next week try 30 and so on, until you can do 100 push ups.
        You don't have to do 100 push straight, you can do 10, rest 30 to 60 seconds another 10
        and repeat until you finish. Don't focus on the time, focus on what you have to do.
        If you have todo 10, 10 it is. Don't matter if you are gonna take 1 minute or 30 minutes. Just
        go through it. Do this everyday and it will help you a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thing, you're not gonna get muscular like a Mr. Olympia's bodybuilder,
        sure you're gonna get a bit muscular, even if you're fat or skinny, but
        you won't get espetacular results just doing that. The overal objective here
        is to increase blood circulation by moving your body. It will also help you with
        discipline, consistency and persistence. 
    </p>
    <h4>Take it to the next level</h4>
    <p>
        First step if you're like I was a few months ago sendentary, best procrastinator
        ever, full of excuses, having a hard time with discipline. Struggling to learn,
        when I say struggling, I mean STRUGGLING. Reading the same thing or going back the
        video I was watching so many times until my head started to get heavy and sometimes
        started hurting.
        <br>
        If you've been through some of these problems, start with step number one, discipline.
        Don't give up find a way you can understand and learn things and build the discipline.
        You can try learning with diffuse mode (maybe you may wanna watch
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O96fE1E-rf8" target="blank">this video</a>),
        you have the Feynman Technique, Spaced repetition technique and so many other ways
        of learning. You gotta find something that works for you and you're only gonna be able
        to find it by trying all of them for <b>enough time</b>. Don't just try once and
        assume it doesn't work. Explore the techniques, change some aspects of it, make sure
        you're spending time actually using it.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to working out, same thing, start with the discipline and consistency.
        Don't focus on the time, focus on what you have to do. One step after the other.
        You're gonna get there eventually. After reaching 100 push ups every day, try 200.
        Try different variations.
        <br>
        After reaching 200 push ups with different variations, try adding squats, same thing
        with squats, do 10, then 20, then 30 and so on, until you've reached 100.
        After doing some squats, dips, then add a pull up bar and stick to it. Don't miss.
    </p>
    <p>
        At some point you'll realize that the exercise is taking
        more and more time, you'll have to split it. Do 100 push ups right after waking up,
        literally right after waking up, before doing anything, 100 push. Then, do your thing,
        wash your face, teeth, eat something and look for some timebox
        during the day to do the remaining 100 for instance
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't make excuses. I'm willing to do push ups on the airport if I have to. Sometimes my
        day is so crazy, I guarantee the 100 push ups during the morning, but I know it will
        be hard to excercise during the day. I excercise at night. I've done this 12 am, 1 am.
        Even if it's only a few push ups, I make sure I've done at least the bare minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
        I realized that at some point during my day, specially when it comes
        to things in which requires a good use of my brain, I can't think straight,
        that's when I take advantage of exercises, so usually during the night, after 7pm.
        That's what works for me. Some people breaks the exercise in half, workou a little bit
        during the morning, then a bit during the night. You can try this.
    </p>
    <h3>Music: Negative and melancholic songs</h3>
    <p>
        Watch out for music. I know, it seems weird right? Some people don't even
        think that the reason they're in a low vibration it's because of the music they're
        listening to during the days. And it's like drugs man, seriously. Sometimes I get
        myself doing basic things listening to music. Like taking a shower, maybe making some tea.
        Don't get me wrong, I love music, but if you're doing everything listening to music
        you gotta make sure it's not music with negativeness. Negative lyrics. Low vibe music.
    </p>
    <p>
        Music can support feelings and emotions and make you practice negative affirmations.
        For instance, if you're angry you'll probably listen to music that supports this
        sentiment. If you're sad you're gonna listen to music that support this sentiment.
        <br>
        The contrary can happen to. Maybe you wanna suppress your emotions by denying them.
        If you're sad or angry you're gonna listen to happy/hype music. Don't do that.
        Learn to deal with your emotions and feelings, you can do that by writing down your thoughts
        and learning more about yourself on this journey, practicing mindgfulness and meditation.
    </p>
    <h3>Cut of negative people</h3>
    <p>
        being direct, cut off negative people from your life. People that
        are energy vampires, people that are negative all the time, people that
        are not happy about anything. Maybe people that are complaining all the time,
        never grateful for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe you know someone that whenever you are around them you can't do anything.
        Maybe because they are with this negative energy making you feel sad or
        to procrastinate or maybe because they are CONSTANTLY
        making negative affirmations towards you. For instance have you ever come accross
        someone that repeats negative affirmations right after you saying that gotta go
        do something that is important to you? Like, "Hey I gotta go, I have to workout today",
        and immediately the other person goes "Don't go, it's great to have you around, you don't need
        to workout today. We can have some great time together blah blah". Or maybe they're are just
        "You really gotta go? I've just oredered another cake and I'm gonna make some tea so we can have lunch together".
        You know? Trying to make you feel guilty for leaving. Making you believe you're the bad guy
        for leaving them there.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not saying you should be a jerk with people. Maybe that's how they are and
        it's tradition on their family to spend a lot of time with people they like.
        But really recommend you to make sure they are not getting on your way. If you really
        wanna hang out with them, make sure to set boundaries. You don't have to spend the
        entire day or skip things on your schedule to make someone else happy. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You don't have to 100% remove people from your life
        and never see them again. But you should spend less time with them if they're affecting
        you negatively, in all aspects. Specially if they're saying negative affirmations towards
        you. You should set boundaries, wich could be another article (maybe it will be), and
        make it clear what you'll tolarate, what you won't. Unfortunately there are people that
        don't understand and they simply can't be part of my life. That's it.
    </p>
    <h4>Maybe they don't understand your journey, your process</h4>
    <p>
        Only talk about your goals, systems and everything that is important to you
        for people who actually comprehend the process. Talking about your process, your
        new routine. Maybe you're trying something different, you got a course or
        started working out or anything else you're trying to change on your life.
        Avoid sharing any of this with people that you now won't understand and will
        criticize you or maaybe laugh at you or anything like that. Worst than that, if
        find yourself worrying about these things constantly with the same person, it's
        a sign this person is toxic and maybe keeping a relationship with him/her
        is clearly not healthy for you.
    </p>
    <h3>Clean up your space</h3>
    <p>
        I think I don't have much to say here. The space you are in, reflects your mind.
        If you're constantly overthinking, always worrying about something, always
        starting things and never finishing them, probably your place is very disorganized.
        Schedule some time to actually clean your space, organize your clothes etc.
        Maybe in your case, you need to clean your virtual space. So your desktop,
        your smartphone etc.
    </p>
    <h4>Don't use this as an excuse for procrastinating</h4>
    <p>
        If you have a system of working out every night at 8pm, worry about cleaning or things
        another time. This is non-negotiable. Let's say you have dishes from dinner to wash,
        they can wait.
    </p>
    <h3>Have systems</h3>
    <p>
        Stablish a system. Even if you don't achieve the goals you've stablished
        at the time you wish or don't achieve at all, you're making constant progress.
        For instance, isntead of focusing on being C2 level at english, I have a system for
        full immersion that I apply EVERY SINGLE DAY, no matter what. Even if i'm sick.
    </p>
    <p>
        You gotta stablish a system and go through as much as possible. If you're sick, make sure
        you're doing the bare minimum, but don't skip it. A couple of months ago I decided
        to take this trip to visit a few friends and this part of the family. It was saturday,
        I spent the night on a bus and got there by saturday 6 am. After that, they pick me up and
        around 8 am we were at their place. I was so excited for being there and with the change
        of not being in my comfort zone, I completely forgot about the 100 push ups routine.
        As soon as I remembered, boom, started doing the push ups. Right there. I felt so much better
        for not skiping something important for me
        If you have a system, it's non-negotiable. Don't skip it.
    </p>
    <h4>Do one thing at a time. Pick something and stick to it</h4>
    <p>
        Do less things, commit to what you've picked. You don't need to worry
        about doing the samething for the rest of your life, but
        you gotta pick one thing at a time, and do it for enough time.
    </p>
    <p>
        This goes from goals to your what you do at a daily basis. Pick only one to 3
        goals and stick to them. Build systems to achieve them. When following the system,
        don't allow any interference. Of you are working out, turn of your phone and
        just workout. I like to listen to something while working out, if you like too,
        make sure that you're not checking it everytime, create a playlist or something and
        put there everything you wanna listen while working out, to prevent yourself from
        using this as an excuse to be checking it everytime.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I like to do is to put my smartphone in <i>do not disturbe mode</i>, put my buds
        and start my podcasts playlist. While i'm working out, no interferences. It may take 15 minutes,
        it may take 2 hours. For that time, I avoid at the max being checking my phone. Doesn't mean
        you gotta do the same, just my way of reducing concurrency between my system and other things.
    </p>
    <h3>It's ok to make mistakes</h3>
    <p>
        One thing I had to relearn and I'm still learning about is <i>it's ok to make mistakes</i>.
        Of course you gotta be responsible about this. For every mistake, there are consequences.
        You gotta be aware of this. But in general, it's fine, just go overcome the fear, allow
        yourself to make mistakes and don't give it too much focus. Just learn with it and
        change your approach. You'll be fine.
    </p>
    <h3>Positive affirmations</h3>
    <p>
        Don't ever go through your days making negative affirmations. The intention
        here is to make yourself aware, not make yourself belief in lies.
        So if you think that just by going around talking to yourself you're rich
        is actually gonna make you rich, you're delusional my friend. Only doing
        that won't make you rich. You gotta put in the work, it's a start, but there's
        a lot of work to make it actually happen.
        In general, just positive affrimations about yourself.
    </p>
    <h4>Don't allow people say negative affirmations towards you</h4>
    <p>
        If someone is constantly saying negative affirmations towards you, set a boundary.
        This can lead you to a limiting belief, take away your energy and time.
        Things like "You can't do this because...", "you're weird", "you're a freak",
        "you will always loose", "you suck at everything", "you're the black sheep" 
        can't take place in your mind.
    </p>
    <h3>Mind wandering</h3>
    <img class="post-img" src="images/self-improvement-raising-your-vibration/thinking.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        Mind wandering is something that cant take away your life. Unless you're intentionally
        just letting your thoughts take place over the primary activity you're doing
        right now, for instance, intentionally practice daydreaming while you're reading this
        post right now, you're losing time and therefore losing your life.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's a lot of things i've been struggling today, one of them is mind wandering.
        Sometimes while i'm eating and specially when i'm in the shower. Random thoughts
        take place and it's kind of like i'm disconnected from this plane. When I get back,
        i've lost 10, 20 minutes. If we stop to think about this and do the math to know the
        amount of time we've lost just going back and forth of this state in a sigle day,
        i'm sure it would scare the hell of all of us.
    </p>
    <h4>Mindfulness</h4>
    <p>
        To help myself with that i've started practicing  mindfulness. As soon as I realize
        i'm mind wandering again, I bring myself back to what i'm doing on the present moment.
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, when i'm doing the dishes, usually I do this listening to some podcasts,
        usually to get some advice on something i'm struggling with or maybe to
        learn about something i'm doing or even to keep me in this state of visualization
        of what i'm trying to manifest in my life. This goes from material things to
        happiness, kindness and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I'm listening to something related to manifestation and
        visualization of my goals, I let my thougths be guided by the positive flow
        of imagination (which is a form of visualization) on purpose.
        <br>
        If I identify some negative
        thoughts, let's say I imagine myself going through a hard time, maybe i start imagining i'm lost,
        maybe feeling the fear of doing what i'm visualizing at that time. I stop immediately and
        bring myself back to the present. Don't let neagative thought invade your manifestation.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to podcasts related to advices or something related, as soon as I start
        mind wandering, I bring myself back to the present. I think of what am I doing right now.
        I'm doing the dishes, this water is cold as hell, it's 10° outside and I can feel the coldness
        through my hands, arms, legs, feet and so on. And I keep in that state. 
    </p>
    <h3>Finish what you've started</h3>
    <p>
        If you start something, finish it. Don't ever let things in half. Because it will
        keep you stressed and result in mind wandering, bring insecurities probably this will
        affect your self confidence, therefore, drain your energy away.
        So if you've picked only one thing to do,
        stick to it and everything you've started, you finish, you're gonna have great positive results
    </p>
    Good Luck XD
