        Hey good to have you here again and if you're reading this,
        you probably is looking for answers on why you're feeling stressed out,
        maybe you're not learning things the way you wanted to.
        Maybe you're not thinking straight, you have this fogginess.
        Or you are just curious. Whatever motive you have to be here, I would like
        to share with you things that worked for me and maybe can work for you too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to PiewediePie's favorite blog about software engineering and today's not
        your average content. Today we're talking about <b>how to raise your vibration</b>.
        Let's get into it!
    </p>
    <h3>Get rid of limiting beliefs</h3>
    <p>
        First of all I would like to start by saying that your limiting beliefs
        will prevent you from achieving things you want and eventually,
        make you miserable. I've been through this myself, still do and
        still fight against them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have you ever thought that you're not cut out for something? Maybe
        because you've failed so many times or beucase someone else failed
        and they've put their limiting beliefs on you, sounds about right?
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll talk (more like write) about this type of people
        in a few moments. But you should fight those limiting beliefs,
        that you can't, that you don't have what's required to do the things
        you wanna do, that's impossible and that it's hard becasue you've failed or
        because someone failed and made you belief on their perspective.
        You gotta fight this. You gotta fight the negative beliefs, not
        by literally fighting or arguing with the other person, but by beign self
        aware and self councious and having a bulletproof mind.
        We're after what is impossible. If it was easy anyone would do. 
    </p>
    <h4>Embrace your suckness</h4>
    <p>
        Think of some area or any goal you've set for yourself that you're struggling.
        For instance, I'm struggling to wake up ealier than usual, and reorganize my
        sleeping routine, therefore reorganizing a few things in my schedule. I can wake
        up ealier for 2 to 3 straight, but at some point, I can't sleep earlier,
        end up going to sleep 1am - 2am and the other day I wake up 2 hours later
        than I was supposed to. That sucks. I suck at this and I've been struggling for
        a few weeks now, since I decided to change a few things on my routine. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea here is not to make you worse, is to be realistic. We can't let
        failures define and dictate our lives. To the contrary, we must accept that
        we've failed and we suck at whatever we're doing and trying different things.
        Just Google it, someone on the internet must beign through what you're beign
        through right now and may give you a different perspective.
    </p>
    <h4>Mapping your limiting beliefs (Journaling)</h4>
    <p>
        You have to map all of your limiting beliefs as well as your negative thoughts
        to understand the root cause. Doesn't have to be everyday, doesn't have to be
        every 2 hours of your day, and doesn't have to be fancy. Just get a paper, a notes
        book and start writing how you are feeling, what you are feeling and try to
        understand "why".
    </p>
    <p>
        I have this book, whenever I feel anxious, stressed, worried, I write my thoughts and
        feelings down with the purpose of identifying why am I feeling those things.
    </p>
    <h4>Take immeadiate action or don't worry about it</h4>
    <p>
        Have you ever experienced sleep deprivation because you where worried about
        something? Maybe you were supposed to do something but you couldn't for
        any reason or maybe you were thinking about situations you've had said
        something and felt guilty about it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If something is bothering you, you should solve it. If you can't means it's not fully
        under your control, let it go. It takes practice but you'll get there eventually.
        Don't let anything get on your way and prevent you from doing the things you've planned
        to do. I'm not saying for you to become a jerk, all I'm saying is to you to
        recognize things are under your control and you can't solve them, and stop worry
        about things that you can't control.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few weeks ago I found myself complaining about the weather because it wasn't
        the way I wish it was etc. I can't control the weather so it doesn't
        makes sense to be mad at it. It's energy lost. Accept what you can't change and
        please <b>bea reasonable about it</b>, do not use your limiting beliefs
        to support the idea that you can't control something that you actually can.

    <h3>Get your body moving</h3>
    <p>
        If you tend to be or in fact is a sendentary you should get your body moving.
        If you find ok to be sitting the entire day, watching movies, working or actually just doing
        nothing at all, that's on you. I find it super stressful and confortable at the same
        time to go through my entire day, spending my life sitting or laying down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Right after waking up don't even thing about it, 10 push ups. Next week do 20 the
        week after next week try 30 and so on, until you can do 100 push ups.
        You don't have to do 100 push straight, you can do 10, rest 30 to 60 seconds another 10
        and repeat until you finish. Don't focus on the time, focus on what you have to do.
        If you have todo 10, 10 it is. Don't matter if you are gonna take 1 minute or 30 minutes. Just
        go through it. Do this everyday and it will help you a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thing, you're not gonna get muscular like a Mr. Olympia's bodybuilder,
        sure you're gonna get a bit muscular, even if you're fat or skinny, but
        you won't get espetacular results just doing that. The overal objective here
        is to increase blood circulation by moving your body. It will also help you with
        discipline, consistency and persistence. 
    </p>
    <h4>Take it to the next level</h4>
    <p>
        First step if you're like I was a few months ago sendentary, best procrastinator
        ever, full of excuses, having a hard time with discipline. Struggling to learn,
        when I say struggling, I mean STRUGGLING. Reading the same thing or going back the
        video I was watching so many times until my head started to get heavy and sometimes
        started hurting.
        <br>
        If you've been through some of these problems, start with step number one, discipline.
        Don't give up find a way you can understand and learn things and build the discipline.
        You can try learning with diffuse mode (maybe you may wanna watch
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O96fE1E-rf8" target="blank">this video</a>),
        you have the Feynman Technique, Spaced repetition technique and so many other ways
        of learning. You gotta find something that works for you and you're only gonna be able
        to find it by trying all of them for <b>enough time</b>. Don't just try once and
        assume it doesn't work. Explore the techniques, change some aspects of it, make sure
        you're spending time actually using it.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it comes to working out, same thing, start with the discipline and consistency.
        Don't focus on the time, focus on what you have to do. One step after the other.
        You're gonna get there eventually. After reaching 100 push ups every day, try 200.
        Try different variations.
        <br>
        After reaching 200 push ups with different variations, try adding squats, same thing
        with squats, do 10, then 20, then 30 and so on, until you've reached 100.
        After doing some squats, dips, then add a pull up bar and stick to it. Don't miss.
    </p>
    <p>
        At some point you'll realize that the exercise is taking
        more and more time, you'll have to split it. Do 100 push ups right after waking up,
        literally right after waking up, before doing anything, 100 push. Then, do your thing,
        wash your face, teeth, eat something and look for some timebox
        during the day to do the remaining 100 for instance
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't make excuses. I'm willing to do push ups on the airport if I have to. Sometimes my
        day is so crazy, I guarantee the 100 push ups during the morning, but I know it will
        be hard to excercise during the day. I excercise at night. I've done this 12 am, 1 am.
        Even if it's only a few push ups, I make sure I've done at least the bare minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
        I realized that at some point during my day, specially when it comes
        to things in which requires a good use of my brain, I can't think straight,
        that's when I take advantage of exercises, so usually during the night, after 7pm.
        That's what works for me. Some people breaks the exercise in half, workou a little bit
        during the morning, then a bit during the night. You can try this.
    </p>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
        Watch out for music. I know, it seems weird right? Some people don't even
        think that the reason they're in a low vibration it's because of the music they're
        listening to during the days. And it's like drugs man, seriously. Sometimes I get
        myself doing basic things listening to music. Like taking a shower, maybe making some tea.
        Don't get me wrong, I love music, but if you're doing everything listening to music
        you gotta make sure it's not music with negativeness. Negative lyrics. Low vibe music
    </p>
    <h4>Low vibration music</h4>
    <h4>Music that brings negative affirmations</h4>
    <h3>Cut of negative people</h3>
    <h4>Obligation</h4>
    <h4>Maybe they don't understand your journey, your process</h4>
    <p>
        Only talk about your goals, systems and everything that is important to you
        for people who actually comprehends the process.
    </p>
    <h3>Clean your space</h3>
    <h3>Have systems</h3>
    <h3>It's ok to make mistakes</h3>
    <h3>Positive affirmations</h3>
    <h3>Mind wandering</h3>
    <h4>Mindfulness</h4>
    <h3>Finish what you've started</h3>
    Good Luck XD
