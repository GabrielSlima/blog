        Hey good to have you here again and if you're reading this,
        you probably is looking for answers on why you're feeling stressed out,
        maybe you're not learning things the way you wanted to.
        Maybe you're not thinking straight, you have this fogginess.
        Or you are just curious. Whatever motive you have to be here, I would like
        to share with you things that worked for me and maybe can work for you too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to PiewediePie's favorite blog about software engineering and today's not
        your average content. Today we're talking about <b>how to raise your vibration</b>.
        Let's get into it!
    </p>
    <h3>Get rid of limiting beliefs</h3>
    <p>
        First of all I would like to start by saying that your limiting beliefs
        will prevent you from achieving things you want and eventually,
        make you miserable. I've been through this myself, still do and
        still fight against them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have you ever thought that you're not cut out for something? Maybe
        because you've failed so many times or beucase someone else failed
        and they've put their limiting beliefs on you, sounds about right?
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll talk (more like write) about this type of people
        in a few moments. But you should fight those limiting beliefs,
        that you can't, that you don't have what's required to do the things
        you wanna do, that's impossible and that it's hard becasue you've failed or
        because someone failed and made you belief on their perspective.
        You gotta fight this. You gotta fight the negative beliefs, not
        by literally fighting or arguing with the other person, but by beign self
        aware and self councious and having a bulletproof mind.
        We're after what is impossible. If it was easy anyone would do. 
    </p>
    <h4>Embrace your suckness</h4>
    <p>
        Think of some area or any goal you've set for yourself that you're struggling.
        For instance, I'm struggling to wake up ealier than usual, and reorganize my
        sleeping routine, therefore reorganizing a few things in my schedule. I can wake
        up ealier for 2 to 3 straight, but at some point, I can't sleep earlier,
        end up going to sleep 1am - 2am and the other day I wake up 2 hours later
        than I was supposed to. That sucks. I suck at this and I've been struggling for
        a few weeks now, since I decided to change a few things on my routine. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea here is not to make you worse, is to be realistic. We can't let
        failures define and dictate our lives. To the contrary, we must accept that
        we've failed and we suck at whatever we're doing and trying different things.
        Just Google it, someone on the internet must beign through what you're beign
        through right now and may give you a different perspective.
    </p>
    <h4>Mapping your limiting beliefs (Journaling)</h4>
    <p>
        You have to map all of your limiting beliefs as well as your negative thoughts
        to understand the root cause. Doesn't have to be everyday, doesn't have to be
        every 2 hours of your day, and doesn't have to be fancy. Just get a paper, a notes
        book and start writing how you are feeling, what you are feeling and try to
        understand "why".
    </p>
    <p>
        I have this book, whenever I feel anxious, stressed, worried, I write my thoughts and
        feelings down with the purpose of identifying why am I feeling those things.
    </p>
    <h4>Take immeadiate action</h4>
    <p>
        If something is bothering you, you should solve it.
