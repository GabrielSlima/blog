        Ok  it's been a while, I know. Maybe I'll write an article about this
        too. But continuing this process of discovery and documentation,
        today's topic is something that maybe not every developer pays attention
        when writing the code. Maybe because we have so many thing to worry
        about or just because it doesn't have enough emphasis as other subjects.

        Anyways, this last few months I've been focusing on exploring more about
        Object Oriented Programming. Found this topic super relevant
        for the simple fact that maybe some principles from the paradigm, are violated.

        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineering and today's topic
        is about what kind of relationship your objects should have or being more direct
        <b>Should you use inheritance or composition? And what is association</b>
    </p>
    <h3>The OOP Review</h3>
    <p>
        As always, I'd like to start reviewing the paradigm. An Object Oriented Program
        is very simple, the execution is a relationship of relating objects. Each object
        represents a entity on our program. This entity posesses behaviors and a state.
    </p>
    <img src="#" alt="OBJECT ENTITY">
    <p>
        These entities are created from templates of code called <b>classes</b>.
        In other words, a class describes what behaviors (methods/functions/procedures)
        and what set of variables will represent the object's state. Every entity
        should have only one purpose. Meaning that every entity acts like if it was
        a completely isolated program. A program generally requires some kind of data
        to fully accomplish it's job. Object entities are not different. For instance,
        maybe you have a Video Object. A video contains duration time, format, maybe a name
        and a specific var for marking the current frame of this video.
        Those variables are part of the object's state.
    </p>
    <img src="#" alt="VIDEO OBJECT">
    <p>
        Objects communicate with each other by sending messages or nowdays, by
        calling each other's behaviors. For instance on our example a MediaPlayer Object
        could reproduce a video and use one of it's behaviors, like video.next_frame()
        to retrieve the next frame to be shown.

    Good Luck XD
