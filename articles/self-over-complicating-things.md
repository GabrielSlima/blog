        Hello hello, I know it's been a while, I know... But today
        I just wanted to share with you a message, specially if you're
        struggling with finishing things or always find yourself
        breaking promises that were made for yourself and you endup frustrated
        or something like that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favorite blog about Software Engineering and
        whatever I want to write about. And today's topic is <b>stop over complicating things bruh</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Excuses, procrastination and lack of clarity</h3>
    <p>
        A few years ago I was anything but a finisher. Because of some past experiences,
        my mind was programmed to do the stuff I wanted to do very easily, they became a habit.
        But I reached this point were I didn't realize how much effort, time and dedication
        it took to reach proficiency at things that mattered to me at that time. It all
        came to a conflict when I started doing stuff I had to do, not stuff that I wanted
        to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ok so, what does doing stuff you like vs doing stuff you gotta do has to do with
        over complication of things? Everything.
        <br>
        Because I was always seeking perfection at the things I liked to do, I never
        realized how hard it was to achieve those things. Simply because I liked it.
        It was natural to me doing those things.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I started doing stuff I didn't like that much, it was painful, it was hard,
        it was a nightmare. I tried to push myself to learn and do those things, but
        with the same approach. It was hard to get started, but once I've started I wanted
        to do everything perfectly. The result was frustration because next day I would
        feel horrible if I didn't give 100% of myself. It was worse when I didn't want to
        do anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Speding hours perfecting, trying to make the best job I could at everything
        was creating this frustration inside of me. Soon I started to feel lost,
        didn't know what to do next because I had so much going on in my mind. I didn't
        have mental clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
        This situation also lead me to procrastination. I was lost, lost track of
        what I was supposed to do, as a result, I started procrastinating because
        i didn't know the next steps. This has happend to me a lot. Actually
        It happend to me a few months ago.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll highlight here a few things I did to get me back on track and
        actually take action towards what really matters.
    </p>
    <h3>Take a few steps back an look at the big picture</h3>
    <p>
        First of all I had to take a few days to actually sit down and thing
        about what I was doing. And with "think" I mean, get a piece of paper,
        pen, cup of coffe and start writting what I was trying to accomplish
        and visualize were what I've been doing the last day fits in this.
    </p>
    <p>
        With that picture in mind, now I can se the previous steps
        I've taking, what am I doing and why, and at least a few steps ahead.
        If what i'm doing doesn't seems to fit, or has a lot of sub-steps
        that doesn't make much sense, I simply do enough to close the topic
        and move on or don't do it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        So for instance let's say you wanna learn Python with the flask framework.
        Why would you include Django into your list? Pick something and stick to it.
        Or let's say you're learning flask, and spent the last few days trying to
        read the entire API Reference. Don't ge me wrong, I love documentation. But if
        your goal is not becoming an Flask specialist, why are you going down this path
        to acquire this knowledge? Worse, why are you worried about acquiring knowledge in the
        hardest way possible?
    </p>
    <p>
        This exercise will bring you back to reality and will bring you back
        the critial thiking. You'll actually judge what you've been doing
        and slowly improve the skill of <i>focus</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>Accept it's simple and move on</h3>
    <p>
        Somthing that is hard for me, and I imagine it's hard for other developers
        too is to accept that simple things are simple and doesn't need
        complication to work the way it's supposed to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Accept that simple things are simple, don't spend time trying to complicate things
        if you don't have to. You don't have to first understand nutrition and how a front
        lever works to start working out. You didn't have to go to school to start walking.
        Keep it simple, accept it and move on.
    </p>
    <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
    <p>
        It was a super quick read, but I had to write something about this. struggling
        with simple things, over complicating them is a common thing. You're not alone.
        It can lead to frustration, procrastination and this horrible feeling
        you will never finish anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        Look out for those behaviors. A wise colleague of mine once said "it's better to do something,
        than not doing nothing at all".
    </p>
    Good Luck XD
