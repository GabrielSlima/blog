        Hello hello, I know it's been a while, I know... But today
        I just wanted to share with you a message, specially if you're
        struggling with finishing things or always find yourself
        breaking promises that were made for yourself and you endup frustrated
        or something like that.

        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favorite blog about Software Engineering and
        whatever I want to write about. And today's topic is <b>stop over complicating things bruh</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Excuses, procrastination and lack of clarity</h3>
    <p>
        Ok I don't know how long this article will be, but at this point I just
        want share with you a few personal experiences. Maybe you can relate with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        I few years ago I was anything but a finisher. Because of some past experiences,
        my mind was programmed to do the stuff I wanted very easily, it became a habit.
        But I reached this point were I didn't realize how much effort, time and dedication
        it took to reach proficiency at things that mattered to me at that time. It all
        came to a conflict when I started doing stuff I had to do, not stuff that I wanted
        to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ok so, what does doing stuff you like vs doing stuff you gotta do has to do with
        over complication of things? Everything.
        <br>
        Because I was always seeking perfection at the things I liked to do, I never
        realized how hard it was to achieve those things. Simply because I liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I started doing stuff I didn't like that much I was painful, it was hard,
        it was a nightmare. I tried to push myself to learn and do those things, but
        with the same approach. It was hard to get started, but once I've started I wanted
        to do everything perfectly. The result was frustration because next day I would
        feel horrible if I didn't give 100% of myself. It was worse when I didn't want to
        do anything at all.

    <h3>Just because it's simple, doesn't mean it's not worth your time</h3>
    <h3>Accept it's simple and move on</h3>

    Good Luck XD
