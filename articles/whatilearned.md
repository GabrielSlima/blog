    When I was starting at programming I did many mistakes and that's ok. But if I'd knew how to prevent them I could've  saved 
    a lot of time to invest doing something else.
</p>
<p>
    Things like "I'm going in the right path?", "I'm doing it right?", "Should I do X, Y or Z?",
    "What to learn and spend my time?", "How to choose my first programming language?", "Should I surrender and pay to learn to code?",
    "What is the best way to learn programming?" and so many other questions where comming into my head that I ended up overwhelmed :/
</p>
<p>
    But don't worry, you don't have to go through all of this like me, and if you do so, that's ok, just continue and be aware that this
    can make you to think that you can't do it, but you can. Just put in the time and don't give up.
</p>
<h3>Make your own path</h3>
<p>
    I spent a lot of time thinking that to have "good job" I would need a college degree and <b>that was a big mistake</b>.
    <br>
    Thinking that the only way to have a "good job" is going to a college and getting good grades is very simple and not so smart.
    If you have 40k and a lot of time to spend in a college degree, great, go for it. But not everyone have the money/time to do so.
</p>
<p>
    Thinking in that way I was limiting and lying to myself. Almost anything can be learned for free on the internet, so why wait till college?
    <b>Start today and see what happens!</b>
    <br>
    There is no "right" or "perfect" path, of course that the tools (programming language, databases, architecture etc.) can be the same,
    but how do you learn them and how to you and become a "highly qualified expert" (just kidding) on it is on you.
</p>
<h3>Try learning with free tools first</h3>
<p>
    You don't need to spend money on bootcamps, today you have online courses,
    the documentation of the language (I use them a lot), books (great for examples),
    Youtube (great for visual things like desing), Instagram (great for ideas) and so many other ways to learn to pogrammimg.
    Choose one (or all of them) and go for it.
</p>
<p>
    Have you never asked yourself how professors learned the things they know, the things they're teaching on schools and how they remember everything?
    <br>
    Try the <b>Feynman Technique</b>.
</p>
<h3>Be project oriented</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept" target="_blank">Proof of concept</a> projects are the best way
    to go. It don't need to have the best desing made by human hands or the best architecture that the human has ever seen,
    you learn by practicing a lot, testing things, doing mistakes and debbuging, literally by brute force.
</p>
<p>
    I got into college (yes, I got into college) I learned to go into all the topics of a 600 pages book to learn something
    and at the end of the day didn't learned anything.
    <br>
    Let's bring some reallity here. You need previous knowledge to do a job? Yes, a little bit, but you need to know the
    entire Java 8 reference guide? I don't think so...
    <br>
    Before I get my first job as a Software Engineer I was studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. I did some stuff using C# and PHP
    too and guess what? The language used in the job was Java :).
    <br>
    And even though the language was Java, they didn't ask me if I've read Java reference guide, they asked me if I could do the job!
</p>
<p>
    The key is, get the project, break into little pieces, learn the topics individually (litte proof of concept projects) 
    and finally apply to the final project (another proof of concept project, but bigger). Can take some time to learn, and implement and
    you can think that your're doing the job twice, but the second or even third implementation of a topic will makes more sense at
    the end of the day than trying to build the whole thing from start.
    <br>
    Thik of a car, there's some many parts to work on, so many little things to build and you still have to learn all of them,
    so start small and bring all the pieces together. Check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm">divide and conquer strategy</a>.
</p>
<h3>Plans are nothing, replanning is everything</h3>
<p>
    I'm a very very methodical and perfectionist person, every single thing had to be planned in details.
    And every single thing I planned changed and I got frustrated. So sad :(
    <br>
    Be flexible and do the necessary, get frustrade, accept that you didn't accomplished what you've planned, replan, and do the work. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Time blocking:</b> instead of study/work 2 straight hours long, plan just 15 min - 20 min. I started with 10 min and moved on</li>
        <li><b>Scrum:</b> Study what adds value to your proof of concept project, prioritize the knowledge to be acquired</li>
        <li><b>Prevent burning out:</b> Don't put so many things to do in a day just because you're starting with a time block of 10-15 minutes, apply the Pareto principle</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h3>Start now, even if don't feel ready</h3>
<p>
    You will never feel ready or feel that you know enough, but you built those projects, youd did so many proof of concept projects, right?
    <br>
    What do you have to lose? Not getting the job you don't already have???
</p>
Good luck XD
