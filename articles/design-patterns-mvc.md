        Solving the same problem over and over again not only is annoying but also a lost of time.
        Software Engineers are problem solvers, but this doesn't mean we should spend time to solve the
        same type of problems over and over again, that's not even productive.

        Welcome to the pewdiepie's  favourite blog about Software Engineering and today's topic is
        Design Patterns and MVC...
    </p>
    <h3>What is a OOP System</h3>
    <p>
        Before continuing with the topic, I would like to remind you that a OOP system or application
        is composed by objects. Objects are entities that are composed by data and behaviors
        enpcasulating them as if they were a package.
    </p>
    <p>
        The objects interact with each other to do what they are supposed to do. Instead of
        having data and functions separated from each other and the program being
        executed in a sequence of events, we see the system as being a composition of
        objects that interact with each other and each object as a blackbox that receives
        the inputs it needs to do the job, manipulates it with it's own procedures
        and state and produces an output.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that being said, as we desing systems some problems start to reapear and
        the natural approach is to reuse an existing solution to solve it. This brings
        us to <strong>design patterns</strong>...
    </p>
    <h3>What is a Design Pattern</h3>
    <p>
        Design pattern is a good and efficient solution that were documented to be used in specific design problems that
        occurs over and over again in the environment. The definition is very simple, as Software Engineers started to
        notice that some of the design problems were appearing and reappearing they started to document the solutions,
        based on their success and failures, so that they didn't had to rediscover them in the future.
    </p>
    <h4>Design Pattern composition</h4>
    <p>
        Every pattern is composed by 4 elements, a name, the problem, the solution and it's consequences.

    <h4>The name</h4>
    <p>
        The name describes the problem the pattern it is supposed to solve, the solution and the consequences for using it.
        The name will help to better identify the pattern. When to use it and when not to and in the communication in
        general. The name generally have a few words, one to three. It's easier to document and gives the first level of
        abstraction for the design.
    </p>
    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
        Describes when to apply the pattern. It explains the design problem and it's context.
    </p>
    <h4>The solution</h4>
    <p>
        Describes the elements that composes the design, how they realate with each other and their responsibilities.
        The template to be used when applying it. The template is abstract. It shows the elements (classes and objects)
        to be used to solve the problem. Their relationships, colaborations and possibilities.
    </p>
    <h4>The consequences</h4>
    <p>
        The trade offs for using the pattern.
