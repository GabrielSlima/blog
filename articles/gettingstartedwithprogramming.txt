<div style="text-align: left;">
    So as the days goes by some friends or friends of my friends get in touch to know how or where to learn how to code or how to find a mentor and so on...
    <br>
    Today i'm gonna tell how I learned to code (a summary), some of my mistakes and what I would do to accomplish this goal if I was looking to learn everything from the beginning again...

    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>My first contact with programming</h3>
    My first contact with programming was in 2015, I've never heard about programming till that year or at least I thought so.
    The funny thing about this is that I was into gamming and I was always involved with tools to cheat. I started a <a href="http://clanzonekill.blogspot.com/" target="blank">blog</a> in Google Blogger to promote my team that I started with some friends. The idea
    was to start my own Clan and the "home" was a server that I created using my dual core, no-ip and tools like Hamachi.
    <br>
    Even thought while working on those things I was using tools like HTML, CSS a little bit of JS, Hexadecimal system, servers and TCP/IP connections I never realized that what I was doing was about Computer Science...

    <br>
    To me all I was doing was about my goals of building something or to configure something to use inside the games.
    <br>
    <br>
    What I'm trying to say is that even though I was always in contact with programming I never thought that 
    it could be a profession, that people would pay me to do those kind of things, it was all about the fun and that's it.
    <br>
    Other than that I can recognize the tools and concepts like TCP/IP now that I've been working with programming, I didn't even know
    what all that stuff was about
    <br>
    <br>

    That being said, now you can see that I'm a pretty normal person, with a normal brain and that I'm not the next Mark Zuckerberg (or maybe I'm?)
    and that I discovered programming on the way...
    <br>
    <br>
    In 2015 I decided to enroll in a technical school, in Brazil it's normal to enroll in some kind of course while in high school.
    Generally people choose technical schools because most of them are "free" and it's a good way to kind of see if they are gonna like the profession or not. 
    <br>
    The only thing I was sure about was that I was going to work with computers, maybe doing some IT stuff...
    <br>
    Later on the second semester of 2015 I was competing with a bunch of other people, most of them teenagers for my place in Software Development at a school called ETEC Professor Basilides de Godoy in SP.
    <br>
    So I got into the course and had my first experience with programming...
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>My first internship</h3>
    The technical course ended in december, 2016 (one and a half year of Software Development course) and a lot o things was going on (maybe I'll tell you in another blog post).
    The thing is, I was more than never sure that I was going to be a Software Developer but at this point I was kind of in the wrong place in terms of knowledge.
    <br>
    <br>
    During the course you take classes from Analysis of Software Requirements to Mobile Development so I decided to learn Backend Development <b>but</b> I chose C# Windows Forms as specialization :).
    <br>
    During the course I also took the right decision of specializing in one group of Technologies, so what I did was to focus on classes that was related to Backend development 
    (C# and SQL) but what I wasn't aware that time was that <b>what was on demand in the market was Web Development, not Windows forms Development</b>.
    And that was <b>my first mistake: not being aware of the skiils that companies needed to accomplish their goals</b>.
    <br>
    <br>
    When I realized this I created a new system to enroll in College and a new one to study Web Development and that was my schedule:
    <img class="post-img" src="images/getting-started-with-programming/schedule.png"/>

    <br>
    <br> 
    The time studying and practicing Desktop development was important to create a study habit and a new concept in my mind: <b>Scpecialization</b>. But wasn't the place I should be if I wanted to get a job fast.
    <br>
    <br>

    In Brazil we have some options to enroll in College or University and though I don't believe in college to learn how to code, many companies in Brazil still have a 
    "traditional" mindset and requires some kind of higher education.
    <br>
    The option I chose 2-3 years ago was public college, Computer's network or Web development would work for me. I ended up going for Computer's network (first option), 
    3 years taking classes from Monday to Saturday in 2018.
    <br>
    I got my first internship on the second semester of 2018, as a Software Enegineer.

    <br>
    <br>
    As you can see, it took me one and a half a year to get my first internship since the end of my technical course and it came from a Junior Software Engineer position, not an internship position.
    <br>
    When I realized that I could be paid as a beginner in Software Engineering I started to apply for Junior positions and it worked, at some degree.
    They offered me a intern position because I didn't have a degree...Anyway, I accepted it and started working.
    <br>
    <br>

    I just want to make it clear that all I'm saying here is <b>based on my experience</b> learning how to code and getting my first interviews.
    I want you to realize that even with a crazy schedule you can <b>create systems and processes</b> to achieve this goal or any goal.
    <br>I wasted so many time overthinking about 
    what to do, if the path I was taking was the right or If I was doing the right thing and the thing is, there is no right path.
    <br>
    The most important thing is to have a process and make progress. The best way I found to see if I was making progress was through projects and actually
    practicing whenever I could.
    <br>
    <br>
    That's just a summary of what happened till I got my first internship. So as I said on this blog post, <a href="https://gabrielslima.github.io/blog/post.html?id=2" target="blank">make your own path</a> 
    and take advantage of my experience to build yours.
    <br>
    <br>

    That being said here is <h3>what I would do to learn how to code today:</h3>
    <b>1 - First of all, start with the skills that companies needs</b>
    <br>
    Go through job posts and start listing all desired skills, don't be afraid, there's lots of things in job posts and they know that's it's super super hard (maybe impossible) to find someone that knows every single thing described there.
    <br> Most companies don't need a unicorn, they need someone with some knowledge (Java, C#, JS, Node and so on) that is open to learn new things and do the job. 
    So start listing...
    <br>
    I used an excel table and created something like that:
    <img class="post-img" src="images/getting-started-with-programming/desired-skills.png"/>

    <br>
    <b>2 - Choose the most appearing skiils and stablish an easy and fast routine to acquire them</h4></b>
    I'm gonna teel you what you want, you want an <b>easy and fast routine that brings results</b>. So here is one suggestion of what I would do: Set a goal <b>to build 3 projects using the new skills.</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    I would break this goal in some sub goals: 
    Set a goal <b>to study/practice/work on side projects programming 1 hour/day, 5 days a week:</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>First month:</b> At least once a week, work to build those skiils for 1 hour</li>
        <li><b>Second month:</b> At least twice a week, work to build those skiils for 1 hour</li>
        <li><b>Third month:</b> At least tree times a week, work to build those skiils for 1 hour</li>
        <li><b>Foutrh month:</b> At least four times a week, work to build those skiils for 1 hour</li>
        <li><b>Fifth month:</b> At least five times a week, work to build those skiils for 1 hour</li>
    </ul>

    You can change the time to 25 minutes, maybe 15 minutes and increase the time every week...just make sure to work on the habit and be honest with yourself.
    <br>
    If you are not feeling practicing some day, try at least 5 minutes and that's it, just make a little bit of progress and create the habit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>3 - The "last" project</b>
    <br>
    The last project can be your own Website showing the projects built with the new skills you acquired. You can use anything to build your Website,
    just make sure it's clean, responsive and fast.
    <br>
    You can use a template if you prefer. If in your list of "companies desired skills" doesn't have HTML and CSS you can maybe hire someone
    on fiver or set a new goal to learn how to build a website and build your own.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>4 - Resume and start applying</b>
    <br>
    At this point you have:
    <ul>
        <li>Habit of studying everyday, five times a week</li>
        <li>Knows how to search on Google</li>
        <li>Have 3 projects and your own website</li>
    </ul>
    So prepare your resume and start applying, don't be afraid of being rejected and don't worry too much with job descriptions. Just apply and that's it.
    <br>
    Search on Youtube how to build a resume as a Software Engineer/Software Developer and build one. To test if my resume is working
    I start applying for jobs during the week and if I don't have at least 1 reply in 2 weeks I go back and start to look for examples and ways to improve it.

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Tools that I would use to study/practice programming and achieve the stablished goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="blank">Hackerrank</a>  - 30 days of code</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="blank">Freecodecamp</a> - Would choose based on my skills list. Strongly recomend following this one first </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="blank">Youtube</a> - You can start looking for "SKILL course", example: "mongodb course"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="questions">Questions that you may have right now and maybe I can answer some of them</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Does age matters?</b> Short answer: No. Long answer: No</li>
        <li><b>What projects should I build?</b> Any project you want. The most common thing is to clone existing platforms or automate something for yourself.
            <br>I did the simplest project one can imagine for a portfolio: <a href="https://gabrielslima.github.io/CatClicker/" target="blank">Cat Clicker</a>
             - Just a web page with a cat photo. When you clicks on the photo it counts 1 and shows the total value in the circle on the middle of the page
        </li>
        <li><b>Udemy courses are worth it?</b> Yes if it has projects to build or you have a project in mind and wanna use the course as a way of getting the necessary knowledge</b></li>
        <li><b>Should I focus on building projects?</b> Yeeess, always</li>
        <li><b>How to manage my projects?</b> Git and Github + Kanban. I've writen a blog post that talks a little bit about <a href="https://gabrielslima.github.io/blog/post.html?id=2">time management here</a></li>
        <li><b>Am I smart enough to be a developer?</b> Can you spell "Pizza"? Then you are. Honestly, since you are able to sit for long hours playing Super Smash Bros for example you are able to be a developer. It just requires practice, like any other things</li>
        <li><b>Which programming language would I choose?</b> Doesn't matter, just get one and stick with it till you've accomplished 3 projects. But if you want to know so badly, I would choose Javascript/NodeJS in 2021</li>
        <li><b>It's going to be easy to find a job?</b> No, that's why you are working on projects and a Web portfolio, to show to a potential employee that you have the necessary skills to do the job</li>
        <li><b>What if it doesn't work?</b> If you can't wait anymore and you've tried <b>almost everything</b> to get a job or maybe it's taking too long, you can try a online code bootcamp, prefer those with projects to build.
            <br>
            Otherwise, reset the goals, work to improve the existing projects, resume, start looking into 1 or 2 more projects to build and start applying again.
        </li>
        <li><b>I chose Web development but I don't know how to build "pretty" websites or I don't have much creativity yet, what do you recommend?</b>
            Build your websites based on another websites.
            <br>
            Example: Lets say you want to build a project of your <a href="https://gabrielslima.github.io/Movie-trailer-WEBSITE/" target="blank">favorite movies and Tv shows</a>. You can look for "gallery website design" on Google and just see what you want on your project.
        </li>
        <li><b>Would I enroll in a College or University?</b> Only if I "failed" trying to learn for free, with a code bootcamp and resetting my goals to improve my portfolio and resume </li>
        <li><b>When I'll know I'm ready?</b> Honestly, you'll ask yourself this many times. You'll know you are ready when you achieve your goals (that's doesn't even makes sense. Be ready to know that I'm ready to reach a goal I've already reached. That's just great). The point is, start before you think you are ready and actually take some time to understand things the best way you can. Don't read just to memorize things, read to actually understand them. </li>
        <li><b>Do you have another recommendation?</b> Yes, don't be lazy and don't compare yourself to others</li>

    </ul>
    <br>
    Good luck XD!!!
