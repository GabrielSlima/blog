        The overall objective of today's article is to summarize important topics you need to know to start
        creating clean code. It's important to understand that a clean code is not attached to a specific language
        or thecnology. Clean code is all about communication through the tools you alredy have, but using
        principles and desing patterns to reveal your intentions
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineering and today's topic is
        <strong>what principles you should know to write clean code</strong>...let's dive into it.
    </p>
    <h2>Super important principles and concepts</h2>
    <p>
        To create clean code, first you start with common sense. You don't need to know any principle
        to know that by mixing up logic that doesn't seems to belong together makes the code more confuse or
        that long source files with long classes and functions are harder to understand. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe you are using some of the following principles and don't even know that it's a thing.
        Let's explore what are some principles we have to help us to create a cleaner code.
    </p>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>
        Starting by one of the first things you learn when starting with programming, the functions.
        when first strating with code we don't write much functions. Usually the instructions are
        pretty simple and the programs are small. Maybe 5 - 10 lines long.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the program's complexity grows at some point you start to notice that a lot of the instructions are
        duplicated. That's when functions starts to appear. Functions are one of the first (if not the first)
        concept we have contact and is the first concept that introduces the conpcet of <strong>modularity</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A module is a logical section. A module can be a function, class, source file or system/application.
        By using functions another super important principle is introduced, <strong>reusability</strong>.
        Functions provides a simple way of reusing existing code to perform a task whenever it's needed.

    <h4>The size</h4>
    <h4>Layers of Abstraction</h4>
    <h4>The names</h4>
    <h4>Amount of Arguments</h4>
    <h4>The stepdown rule</h4>
    <h4>Error handling</h4>
    <h3>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
    <p>
        In procedural programming, our system/application is composed by procedures/functions/methods and data strucutres.
        To help us to organize things, let's say, if a source file is getting too long, modules can be
        used to split the code into one or more other source files.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Object Oriented Programming our system/application is composed by Objects. We also have procedures
        and data structures, but the objects group them and act as if they were independent from each other.
    </p>
    <h4>Classes</h4>
    <p>
        The definition of a class can be achieved in a few words, a class is a template for creating objects or
        data structures. Classes can be composed by data (variables/attributes) and behaviors (methods/functions).
        The functions can have (or not) a body.
    </p>
    <h4>What objects are?</h4>
    <p>
        Objects are like mini programs that runs within the system/application. They are
        composed by data and behaviors members. The data members represents the object's state. The
        behavior members are used to change the object's state or retrive information about them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Objects can interact with each other by using each other's public interfaces.
        For instance, you can have a <strong>report_generator</strong> object and a <strong>report_printer</strong>
        one. The can call each other's public behaviors.
    </p>
    <h4>Data Strucutres created based on classes?</h4>
    <p>
        Classes can also be templates for Data Strucutres. A data structure is a way of storing data
        into your computer. A Data Strucutre doesn't have behaviors related to business logic.
        Value Object (VO) or a Data Transfer Object are examples of Data Strucutres created based on
        a code template (Classe).
