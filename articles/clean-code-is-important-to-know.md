        The overall objective of today's article is to summarize important topics you need to know to start
        creating clean code. It's important to understand that a clean code is not attached to a specific language
        or thecnology. Clean code is all about communication through the tools you alredy have, but using
        principles and desing patterns to reveal your intentions

        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineering and today's topic is
        <strong>what principles you should know to write clean code</strong>...let's dive into it.

    <h2>Super important principles and conpcets</h2>
    <h3>What Classes are and what Object Oriented Programming is?</h3>
    <h4>Classes</h4>
    <p>
        The definition of a class can be achieved in a few words, a class is a template for creating objects and
        data structures. Classes can be composed by data (variables/attributes) and behaviors (methods/functions).
        The functions can have (or not) a body.
    </p>
    <h3>Data Strucutres != Objects</h3>
    <p>
        A Data Structure is a way of storing data into your computer. A Data Strucutre doesn't have
        behaviors related to business logic.
