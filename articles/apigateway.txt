Recently I helped a family member with some tasks from college and  with  some  tips on what to use to study and understand programming.
We sat down with some coffe and started to go throught some  stuff at the computer.
It was  cool, most of the  tools are "free"  and he can learn to build some cool projects if he continues with it.
<br>
<br>
But he said something very interesting to me when we where  talking about the market and what we do in a daily bases.
He works with Network Monitoring and plans to switch his career to Software Engineering.
<br>
<br>
He told me that he has self doubt and doesn't know if he is capable of doing the job in Software Engineering. That's interesting because  that's exactly the kind of thought I've had  in the  beginning 
and is the kind of thought I have in every new project. I'll tell you what another very experienced developers told me and eventually I told  him.
<br>
<br>
This kind  of thought generally comes when we  don't know what to expect  in a situation,  in that case, the job or project.
Truth is that  we  don't know what will be asked to be done, what kind of tools we'll be using to  do the job or if the tasks are hard or not to accomplish.
But one thing has  to be clear in our minds, <b>we'll delivery the job no matter what</b>.
<br>
<br>
Don't  get me wrong, I know that "bad" projects  or "teams" do exists but what I'm trying to say is that if you look the situation as a finisher not a quitter things start to get less worse
and you stop wasting time thinking if you'll be able to do the job and  starts to focus on what really matters, <b>getting things done</b>.
<br>
This kind of thoughts will always be there , in many areas of your life. But  they can't stop you from doing what has  to be done.
<br>
<br>
What helps me a lot in cases like that is to focus in projects. Almost every new concept  has  a practical approach. Practicing brings  confidence and helps you 
with problem solving. That's something I've been using in many aspects  of my life.
<br>
<br>
Good  Luck! XD
