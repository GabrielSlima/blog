    <h3>What Object-oriented desing is?</h3>
    <p>
        An object-riented desing is the process of defining objects and their interactions
        with the purpose of solving a software problem. The result is a system of interacting
        objects, also knwon as <strong>object-oriented program</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        An object is an entity composed by data and behaviors (the methods/functions/procedures).
        The procedures act upon the object's data, manipulating them, changing the object's
        state or retrieving information about it. The interfaces (the public methods) are
        how the object can be interacted with. The overall objective is that the object
        represents a single concern within the system/application/program and interact with
        your own data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Object-oriented desing is the process of identifying the objects (their data, interfaces and implemetations)
        and how they interact with each other to solve one or more problems. 
        It is an approach to Software Desing. The process of desiging software
        solutions. The solution can be low-level (component or algorithm) or high-level (architecture).
    </p>
    <h3>Object-oriented analysis</h3>
    <p>
        To understand object-oriented designs, first we have to
        understand what information we need for using this process.
        The input for this process is achieved in the OOA (Object-oriented
        analysis), an approach for identifying and documenting
        problems. In other words, the object-oriented design will
        represent a object-oriented program that will solve one or
        more problems that were indetified and documented during the OOA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every application/system has a life cycle. I would say that today
        every development process has a life cycle. Why?
        Simple because today you don't develop an entirie application/system
        from the ground up. You create it in small pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
        The development life cycle is composed by: analysis, desing, coding,
        testing and deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the <strong>watterfall</strong> approach (an approach
        for software develpment), these phases are accomplished one
        after the other. This means that first we do the analysis
        and have a well and abstract description of the requirements,
        then and only then we create the designs that represents
        the solutions based on the requirements for the software.
        Then we move on to the coding phase, then we test and deploy.
    </p>
    <p>
        the objective of any analysis activity in this life-cycle
        is to create a model of the requirements that is independent
        of implementation rules. In other words, the requirements are
        translated into diagrams that represents the requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many other software life-cycle models in which
        the phases are accomplished in different ways. This subject
        deservers an entire article or series of articles.
        <br>
        In short, the Object-oriented analysis falls into
        the analisys phase and the outputs are diagrams.
        In this approach the requirements are organized in objects
        and, if you read <a href="#" target="blank">this article</a>
        you know that objects are composed by data and behaviors to
        represent entities into the application/system. So naturally
        these two aspects are dealt with together instead of separately,
        like in other software analysis approaches.
