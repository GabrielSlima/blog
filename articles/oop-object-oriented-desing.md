    <h3>What Object-oriented desing is?</h3>
    <p>
        An object-riented desing is the process of defining objects and their interactions
        with the purpose of solving a software problem. The result is a system of interacting
        objects, also knwon as <strong>object-oriented program</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        An object is an entity composed by data and behaviors (the methods/functions/procedures).
        The procedures act upon the object's data, manipulating them, changing the object's
        state or retrieving information about it. The interfaces (the public methods) are
        how the object can be interacted with. The overall objective is that the object
        represents a single concern within the system/application/program and interact with
        your own data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Object-oriented desing is the process of identifying the objects (their data, interfaces and implemetations)
        and how they interact with each other to solve one or more problems. 
        It is an approach to Software Desing. The process of desiging software
        solutions. The solution can be low-level (component or algorithm) or high-level (architecture)

    Good Luck XD
