        Last article about the <a href="https://gabrielslima.github.io/blog/post.html?id=27" target="_blank">relationship</a>
        between the objects of your application. In that article I mentioned
        that association can be a better choice because the encapsulation
        of a class that uses inheritance, can be broken depending of where
        and what the programmer changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        So I decided to create this article talking about specifically
        about this subject. Welcome to the Pewdiepie's favourite
        blog about Software Engineering and today's topic is
        <b>Does inheritance breaks encapsulation</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Inheritance, what is it?</h3>
    <p>
        From Wikipedia:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class
            upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In practice we can create one template based on another template.
        In this way <i>one template inhertis the other's description (variables and methods)</i>,
    </p>

    <h3>Encapsulation, what is it?</h3>
    <p>
        Again, another definition from Wikipedia:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Encapsulation refers to the oacking of data with the methods
        that operate on that data.
    </blockquote>
    Good Luck XD
