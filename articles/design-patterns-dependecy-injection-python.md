        Object Oriented code can be complex, that's a fact.
        This is completely normal, that's why refactoring is important,
        to keep an emergent architecture as simple as possible
        as the system grows.
    </p>
    <p>
        But as the system grows, more and more dependecies appears.
        An Object Oriented Program is a relationship between the
        objects that are part of the solution. So naturaly some of
        those objects depends on other objets to do their job. 
    </p>
    <p>
        But manage those dependeces can be quite difficult if you have
        a larger system with lots of objects, including objects
        that deals with the business rules/use cases, data placeholders,
        api encapsulation and so on.

        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineer.
        Probably the next big company will grow from here, and today will
        be showing to you how do I implement <b>dependence management</b>
        using dependecy injection in Python without the use of frameworks or
        external libs.
    </p>
    Good Luck XD
