        If you read the article about the difference between <a href="https://gabrielslima.github.io/blog/post.html?id=10" target="blank">Objects and Data Structures</a>
        or if you already have experience writting OOP code you know that Objects are like "mini programs" that composes an application
        and that Classes are the templates for creating those objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far, if you've read the last articles you know how to create <b>clean and meaningful functions</b>. But how can we create Clean Classes?
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineering and today
        you are going to learn what do you need to create Clean Classes. Let's get into it!

    <h3>How Classes should be structured: The Organization of Classes</h3>
    <p>
        Files should be strucutred as a newspaper article. The name and title should convey what the article is about. The first paragraph
        should introduce the topics to be  explored on the following paragraphs and the body should explored those topics, adding details
        as we go down...        This "way" of writting the code is called <a href="https://gabrielslima.github.io/blog/post.html?id=7" target="blank">The Stepdown Rule</a>.

    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
    <h3>Small Classes</h3>
    Good Luck XD
